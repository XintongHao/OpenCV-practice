I used one whole egg in a measuring cup and topped it up to 3/4 cup with egg whites from a carton. I put it all into my bread machine and set it for 1.5 lb loaf and medium crust.

Personally, I like the sharp edge that this only hints at.<br /><br />What's not: Vanilla. I meean, I like vanilla, and the warm vanilla musk fills my nose more than with anything else I can remember - including most vanilla ice cream.

Even better, during our dogs' last two annual health/dental checkups -- the vet did NOT recommend we bring the dogs in for teeth cleaning.

I ground up my shoulders, mixed in the spices, then reground a second time. Some of the best sausage I have ever had. Tastes like NY style sausage with the fennel in it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking to save money on sausage. I estimated I have about 1.75 a pound into it where store bought is over 3.50 a pound. It is also very healthy.

They also seem to have less feces, which is a sign of a good diet.  We have purchased 3 (15lb) bags since being informed of the P&G buyout, I have not noticed any differences but it may be hard to tell until the stock made by the previous manufacturer is exhausted.  In the meantime, I plan on sticking with this food.  I would like to try the Sweet Potato but don't want to buy such a high cost food and then find out they don't like it.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "The conditioner ingredients are unremarkable - chemicals plus oils from almonds, coconuts, soybeans and sunflower seeds. Many conditioners have a similar smell - not a heavy perfume - just that of a typical hair product.<br /><br />Many conditioners now have bottles with lids at the bottom. This is no exception, the bottle is elegant and simple - not fat - so it only contains 12.7 fl. oz. (375 ml), yet is the same height as a 25.4 fl. oz. (750 ml) bottle - clever packaging to make you think you've bought more than you really have. What differentiates this conditioner is its consistency. It is neither too thick to pour nor too runny to drip. It has just the right creamy consistency that makes it easy to rub into the hair.<br /><br />I have thick, dry, over-treated hair that can be quite brittle. The conditioner performed as well as the conditioners that typically come with hair color. I have used a paraben free SimplyU conditioner from Walmart that I like better.<br /><br />I compared this conditioner with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QXC97W\">Dove Daily Moisture Therapy Conditioner, Dry/Rough Hair, 40 Ounce (Pack of 2)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004A8V8A4\">Garnier Fructis Conditioner, Fortifying, Pure Clean, Normal Hair, 13 oz.</a>.  Both of these were thicker and in both cases I had to put water in the bottle to dilute them - so they probably will last for more shampoos per fluid ounce (or milliliter) than the Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Conditioner, which I have not had to dilute.<br /><br />I don't wash my hair every day - so the idea of a Nourishing Daily Conditioner doesn't appeal - however I do use conditioner once or twice a week. It has left my hair manageable, just as any other good conditioner would.<br /><br />This conditioner is not one I would rave about, but it does have excellent creamy consistency that makes it easy to apply.  I like paraben free, very simple products. This has about 30 ingredients - are they really all necessary?\n",

      "I've tried five flavors of Spry gum: peppermint, spearmint, green tea, fresh fruit, and cinnamon. Cinnamon is by far my favorite. The flavor lasts for longer than any of the other Spry flavors. The warming effect of cinnamon oil also offsets the cooling effect of xylitol, making it not feel as strange in the mouth.<br /><br />I really like that the gum is flavored with xylitol. Unlike some brands that advertise that they contain xylitol, Spry actually uses it as their only sweetener. Most sugarless gums make me sick, as I can't handle sorbitol and maltitol well. It's great that I can chew this without having intestinal problems.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "Orijen makes by far the best dog food you can buy. It's expensive but well worth it, especially when you take into account how much you will save on vet bills and the great boost it will give to your dogs overall health and well being.. It is grain free which is very important as grain is not part of a dog's normal diet and besides mostly being filler, grains can cause allergies and other issues. My 5 year old German Shepherd is on Orijen Adult and has done incredibly well on it, stunning coat, great energy, consistently firm, and virtually odor-free, poops. I also have a large male Golden who is now 13 1/2 years old and doing fantastic. He at Orijen Senior until about 3 years ago when we switched him to Orijen Senior. Other than a little arthritis in his hips and knees (to be expected) he is perfectly healthy and his last blood panel came back incredibly good. My vet says we are doing all the right things (daily walks and exercise, filtered water, Orijen Senior food) especially since large Goldens typically only live to 10 or 11. When we are out walking quite often we meet much younger goldens (6 to 8 years) that look much older than he does. It really does show what a difference diet and exercise make both in humans and in our canine companions. We have a new puppy (that we adopted from the Best Friends Animal Society) and she is on a mix of Orijen Puppy and doing great. Highly recommend Orijen Adult, Senior and Puppy.<br /><br />Note:<br />Many years ago we fed our dogs Canidae because it was decent quality and we were financial limited. But, when the Canidae manufacturer suddenly changed their formula (added more grain and fillers) all of our dogs had bad reactions (diarrhea, vomiting, scratching, skin allergies etc). Numerous trips to the vet and lots of dollars for tests only to find out they were all having a reaction to the poor quality ingredients in their food. That was when I began researching dog food ingredients and decided to go grain-free with a company that only makes dog food. Could not be happier with my decision to spend more on Orijen. Very wise decision on my part, and my dogs are much healthy now than they have ever been.\n",

I was very pleased to find this product at amazon.com.  It was very easy to place an order and it arrived very quickly.  I make a gallon of iced each day and sweeten the tea with these saccharin tablets.  I bring a full 2 quart pan of water to a boil and when it reaches a boil, I turn off the burner and then add 6 teabags.  I dip the teabags in the water exactly six times and then add 8 tablets of necta sweet saccharin tablets.  The tea then steeps for about five minutes and then is poured into a gallon pitcher.  I then add cold water to fill it up to the gallon mark and stir.  The necta sweet tablets are the best!<br />The tablets dissolve quickly, the flavor is great (no after taste)!  This is as close to making my grandma's sun-tea as it gets.  I drink iced tea all year round like other folks drink coffee, and cutting back on sugar intake is a must.  Necta sweet is a great product, so if you are using it now, keep using it.  And, if you haven't tried it yet, you should try it.  You will probably like it as much as I do!\n",

I was happy with all nutritional content;<br />however, I was a little disappointed with the number of carbohydrates<br />included in the bar. Carbs are always good, especially after an intensive<br />cardio workout, and especially if complex, but I am always picky about the<br />number of carbs in any nutrition bar; therefore, that somewhat bothered me<br />(and yes, I am aware that many of the best protein/energy bars do include a<br />high number of \"good\" carbs; however, the carb factor is something I have to<br />accept). Aside the carb factor, I was happy with all other nutritional<br />aspects of the bar, such as the bar only being 160 calories (considering its<br />size!), the bar including two servings of fruit, the bar having 4 grams of<br />dietary fiber, and the bar being organic and high fructose corn<br />syrup-less!!!! The taste of the bar was not the best I have tasted, but it<br />was tasty nonetheless. In fact, my three year old-toddler, has favored this<br />strawberry-flavored bar as his current favorite snack food, which suits me<br />well, because he is a thin child, and if these bars please and nourish him,<br />I have no complaints. Buying the bars in bulk is probably a better choice,<br />because it is certainly more cost effective. \"Great bars worth the price\" is<br />certainly my review.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "I am on the record in several reviews here at Amazon as saying that in my experience, which is pretty good with mueslis in the US and Europe, Dorset Cereals make the best mueslis anywhere. This cereal is no exception. I truly enjoyed this great blend that concentrates on sunflower and pumpkin seeds for a nutty flavor, and on raisins and date for sweetness.<br /><br />What I don't like is Dorset's new packaging in 12-ounce boxes. I have noticed at local stores that this is the new standard size across the board -- a dramatic reduction in size per box of 30-40% compared to the previous standard sizes of 18-21 ounces per box.<br /><br />While sizes have been cut, prices have remained essentially the same. This is basically a price hike of one third or more. Raising prices is actually fine, but doing it by cutting box sizes seems sneaky and rubs me the wrong way. Dorset has priced itself out of the market for me for a while.<br /><br />If the price seems reasonable to you, I repeat that Dorset makes outstanding products and you can't go wrong on that score.\n",

      "Peppermint Altoid mints REALLY do a fine job of making your breath fresh with their extra strong peppermint flavor. For some people these may taste a little too strong, perhaps; but I enjoy them very much.<br /><br />Altoid mints are very low in calories, fat, sodium and more. The main effect, therefore, is simply to make your breath its very freshest. They come in that famous little tin that keeps them fresh until their expiration date.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend Altoids as THE ultimate in breath mints. People who also simply love that strong peppermint taste will delight in these, too.<br /><br />Great job, Altoids!\n",

      "My husband has raved about Slap Stix from his childhood (he's in his 40's.) He thought they had stopped making them because he hasn't been able to find them anywhere in over 10 years. For an early holiday gift and to try them myself, I decided to look online to see if they were still made, found & bought some. After tasting these, I see why he loved them. The flavor is really unmatched by any of the candies out there today. Although it says \"lollipop\" in some of the descriptions, its really more of a taffy and caramel blend on a stick that you can lick but will end up chewing.<br />  Its based in caramel with flavored taffy's swirled in-the yellow is banana, and is the flavor most tasted along with the caramel. The white gives hints of vanilla, while the pink I think just adds to the sweetness. These are not too sweet or overwhelming though, and while the combination sounds a little off, when it comes together in this candy, it tastes wonderful. It does have different textures while chewing-Soft caramel, taffy in the pink and yellow, and a fluffy nugget like consistency to the white swirl.<br />  Buying from another online site before, I'd recommend buying from Amazon instead simply because of some packages being Prime eligible and variety of options (Count of bulk, buying alone, or in gift baskets with other candies of the same era.) If you plan on buying candy gift baskets by era's, I would suggest getting a package of these as well and adding more to the basket or even adding them to gifts with the bows and ribbon. However, these aren't something I'd recommend for a person with dentures. These are hard to find locally, so online is the way to go. I'm definitely buying again, only this time I'll save on shipping and go with Amazon. Hope this helps those who haven't had them before but have a friend raving about them:)\n",

      "I just recently tried the San Francisco Bay Coffee one cup for the Keurig and instant brewers. I was a little leery of trying them as many people have been but decided to give them a try. They were a little less expensive and I figured if I liked them it would be worth it. I love the flavor. I don't mind the way its packaged at all. And they work great in my Keurig machine. The only difference I find is because of it being a filter holding the coffee rather than the plastic cup with a tiny hole - after the coffee is brewed it drips a while longer because of the open filter. Not a big deal - just something to mention. The other thing about the SFBay French roast that I bought - compared to the other French Roast varieties - when I use my largest cup setting on my Keurig machine (mine has 3 sizes to choose from) it is not nearly as strong. If I use the small setting, which is about half the amount - it is the same strength as other French roast K-cups. So for me - wanting to save a little money by trying the San Francisco Bay cups - it really isn't working out that way as I use 2 K-cups on the small cup setting to fill my big coffee mug. So price wise - it comes out about the same as what I have been paying for the others. But it is excellent - strong and good flavor. I kind of like that they come packaged in individual plastic bags of 12. And it is no big deal to put them in a little jar or container by my machine. I do that with my regular coffee maker - so this is no different. Not sure why others feel that is a problem. Hope this helps anyone who is considering buying this brand. I would definitely recommend it - and would give it 5 stars on taste - but just did 4 because of it not making a large mug as strong as I like.\n",

Tocotrienols are antioxidants which inhibit cholesterol synthesis and have been found to lower blood cholesterol.<br /><br />-  Eating oats can spread the rise in blood sugars over a longer time period.<br /><br />Benefits of Almonds:<br /><br />-  Almonds lessen after-meal surges in blood sugar.<br /><br />-  Almonds lower cholesterol.<br /><br />-  Almonds contain magnesium.  Magnesium is a calcium channel blocker. Magnesium helps veins and arteries relax, reducing resistance and improving flow of blood, oxygen throughout the body.<br /><br />-  Five large human epidemiological studies, have found that nut consumption is linked to a lower risk for heart disease.\n",

When it's cold out, the cats can't decide whether they want to go in or out and every time the dogs come in from outside, they're hyped up and full of energy. When it's raining, everyone goes stir crazy from being cooped up inside. Since Texas winters don't see much in the way of snow, we tend to get a lot of rain. Thankfully, we now have TunaTreats to help keep the kitties calm.<br /><br />TunaTreats are dried flakes of 100% pure bonito fish. The first time the container was opened, the cats went wild. The pieces, thinner than paper and light enough to blow away if you're not careful, came out of the container in manageable clumps. Next thing I knew, five cats were swarming me, looking up and meowing, trying to climb my chair. I had a captive audience! What I didn't expect was the moment the dogs joined in.<br /><br />TunaTreats are completely healthy and a good \"anytime\" treat. Our kitties get a good-sized pinch of their new favorite TunaTreats a couple of times each day. With this, they stay nice and calm as they munch. They've also learned to eat all their TunaTreats - our dogs are just waiting for a cat to leave a little bit behind!\n",

      "I was looking for a meal supplement bar that is high in protein (16g) and fiber (4g). This fit the bill, and it's also (relatively) low on carbs (10) and calories (150).<br /><br />The lemon coconut flavor was a nice change from most protein bars' chocolate or peanut butter. It has the consistency something like a rice-krispie treat. It's nice that it's NOT coated in chocolate that melts and makes eating at your desk a mess.<br /><br />The only knock on these bars is the price. At about $2 per bar, it's one of the priciest on the market. I've never found a bar with higher protein and fiber at 150 calories; but I've found some that come close. The \"close\" ones are about half the price too. I really liked the Simply bars and I'm keeping an eye out for sales. When buying 3 boxes (45 bars) doesn't cost $100 I'll definitely buy again.\n",

      "I have had several of these kits, and mostly they come out pretty thin. It has been suggested to cut back to 5 gallons. This still leaves a wine that is thin and lacks any acceptable mouth-feel. Here's how I do it with a red wine kit.<br /><br />White wines are treated the same only I make them to the 5 gallons, not 4; still reserving some juice concentrate.<br /><br />1. Pour off 1 1/2 cups of concentrate into a sterile Ball jar. Place this in the freezer.<br /><br />2. Make the remainder up to 4 gallons. Do primary fermentation.<br /><br />3. From primary, rack to secondary (for me that is a 3 gallon carboy and a one gallon jug) Top up with simple syrup (2 parts sugar to one part water OR up to 1/2 of your retained juice) This is where I would also add in the oak chips if I am using them.<br /><br />4. This will not finish fermenting in the 4-6 week time frame. More like 8 to 16. I rack again at about 4 to 5 weeks.Clear, stablize and de-gas.<br /><br />5. At bottling time (here is were I filter w my mini Boun-Vino)<br /><br />6. Add 1/4 teaspoon Potassium Sorbate.<br /><br />7. Pour the retained juice that has been thawed to room temp into the filtered wine before bottling.<br /><br />Yes, I know. 4 gallons from a 6 gallon kit. But believe me, it is worth the loss.<br /><br />This 4 gallon volume is still a great bargain, especially if you have an Amazon Prime membership to cut the shipping costs. It comes out so well that I have put this item on subscription to save even more.<br /><br />Considering the fact that you get both corks and shrink cap (and labels, I suppose, I like to design my own) Even 4 is gallons cheaper (bottle for bottle) than a premium kit.<br /><br />All that being said, it is still a kit with kit quality. Don't expect a great wine to come from this. But follow my method and you'll have a wine you would be proud to serve your friends.<br /><br />(An additional note: I've also done this with Amazon's Reserve du Chateau kits, but adjusting the primary fermentation to 5 gallons because of the extra 3 pounds of juice in the kit. This comes out very well).\n",

The SF Coffee K-cups do not look like other K-cups in that they do not have the plastic base which contains and seals around the coffee filter.  This exposes the coffee to air and faster oxidation.  When drinking the coffee it lacks a fresh flavor and tastes a bit stale.  The K-cups come in a sealed plastic bag, but once its opened, the k-cups are exposed to air and they quickly go stale.<br /><br />The coffee flavor is a bit weak as well.  The lack of the plastic housing around the coffee filter, in my opinion, causes the water to flow thru the coffee too quickly and contributes to a weak flavor.<br /><br />I don't think I would buy these again.\n",

I never thought to look before now, and have been ordering it direct from Starbucks and paying their exorbitant shipping charges. I sucked it up because I have to have this coffee. I am not a fan of hot coffee, but I am an iced coffee junkie. I have been known to double fist the 32 oz iced coffees from McDonald's, I am that ridiculous.<br /><br />When the Starbucks Via Iced Coffee came out late last year, I couldn't wait to try it.  I first drank it just with cold water and ice.  It is already sweetened, so we are good to go there.  I missed my sweet, milky iced coffee from McDonald's, so I had to experiment a little bit.  I tried adding a little skim milk.  That helped, it tasted even better.<br /><br />Then I bought a gallon of 2% chocolate milk, and put a bit of that in instead of the regular milk. Oh my gosh! I have a better tasting iced coffee (in my opinion) than I can buy at any cafe.  It is so delicious, and I look forward to it every morning.  I think this VIA is made to be mixed with milk, it is strong so that the rich coffee flavor shines through even with milk mixed in.  When I run out of chocolate milk, I use skim milk with a good squeeze of Nestle Quick syrup, a good alternative.<br /><br />I have been trying to find a good iced coffee to make at home for several years, and this is it...I was brewing whole pots of hot coffee and trying to add ice and vanilla syrup, and coffee creamer...bleh, it was so much work and tasted half as good as this!

      "I bought this because our cats insisted on climbing on the counter to chew on our fake plants. It took less than a week from the time we got the kit until it was ready to give to the cats. The cats took to it immediately. We set it on the cat tree which gives it some indirect sunlight, and the kitties can climb up to munch on it. The planter is heavy enough that the cats aren't able to knock it around. It starting wilting after a couple weeks, but even then, the cats would eat it. We're getting another kit in addition to extra seeds. That way we can have one growing while they're eating the other. Then when the one starts to wilt, we can switch them out.\n",

She mentioned that her cat didn't care for the salmon in it, however, the concept of the food is excellent. Well, yes, I agree, although, I would have given this excellent cat food the highest rating. My cats, all 5 of them, love all the flavors of this brand. And they are very finicky too.<br />I hope they introduce even more flavors of this ultra healthy brand of feline food in the future.\n",

      "The picture on the product page still shows the older, rectangular packaging. What arrived was 24 of the new, smaller containers but they hold the same amount of Whiskas Cat Milk. I applaud Whiskas for reducing the packaging but, since I'm a bit slow, I ordered this based on the picture of the old rectangular boxes. My local store started carrying the new packs and I, without bothering to read the fine print, thought they were selling less product for the same price. I'm glad I did though because this was a great buy (of course I now have over a 6 month supply but the \"Best By\" date is beyond the 6 months).<br /><br />I started giving this to my little IBS kitty every day because she was on a course of medicine that, although it was supposed to be tuna flavored, she wouldn't take. I mixed it into the Cat Milk and she lapped it up. After we'd finished up the medicine, she still asked for her Cat Milk treat so now I give it to her while I dish out everyone's canned food. It's a perfect distraction 'cause she used to try to \"help\" and be in the way \"testing\" each bowl as I dished out the canned food. I guess you could say the Cat Milk is a bribe but either the medicine worked or the Cat Milk helped (or both) 'cause she's put back on the weight she'd lost during her last Irritable Bowl bout (and when my vet weighed her he said keep on doing whatever it is you're doing).\n",

It's thin and bland, like a 7-11 or Dunkin Donuts \"East Coast\" style coffee. Stay away unless you are timid or faint-hearted.<br /><br />So avoid the variety pack and order a box of Black Tiger.

Above-average fat. And below carbs when compared to a typical dry dog food.<br /><br />Free of any plant-based protein boosters, this looks like the profile of a kibble containing an abundance of meat.<br /><br />When you also consider its lack of any critical Red Flag items, it becomes obvious we're evaluating an exceptional dry food.<br /><br />Bottom line?<br /><br />Nature's Variety Instinct is a grain-free kibble using an abundance of meat and poultry meals as its main sources of animal protein... thus earning the brand five stars.<br /><br />Enthusiastically recommended.\"<br /><br />***petfoodratings.net gives the product 5 Stars as well, saying:<br /><br />What's good about this food....<br />Grain-free, very high in quality meat content (first 3 ingredients), pumpkinseeds are great for fiber & skin/coat, herring meal, fruits/veggies.<br /><br />....and what's not so good.<br />Nothing.<br /><br />***dogfoodanalysis.com also lists this as one of their 6 star (best) brands.  The packaging is different, as it was from 2009, but same ingredient list:<br />\"The first and fifth ingredients in this food are named meat products, in meal form. Although it is easier to have confidence that there is a good amount of meat in a food when there are multiple meat meal ingredients heading the ingredient list, the supporting macronutrient breakdown of this product lends a high level of confidence in the amount of meat product in the food. The inclusion of fish meal amongst the major incredients provides a good source of omega 3 and 6 OFAs.<br /><br />Tapioca is the starch content with primary purpose as thickener. It is the second ingredient in a food with likely carbohydrate content of around 26% DMB.<br /><br />There are no grains in this food. The major carbohydrate source is tapioca, which may be particularly useful for dogs with sensitivities to potatoes or who suffer arthritis. There is a good range of fruits/vegetables in the food, and a good range of probiotics.<br /><br />We note that chicken fat is the third ingredient in the food and that research at Purdue University has identified fat in the top four ingredients of dry dogs foods as a factor increasing the risk of bloat in large breed dogs. The presence of citric acid as a preservative means that this food should not be pre-moistened prior to feeding (pre-moistening of foods preserved with citirc acid has also been identified as a factor increasing the risk of bloat).<br /><br />This food is outstanding in that it contains no grains whatsoever. Grains are not a natural part of a canine diet and it is pleasing to see dog foods on the market that exclude grains completely from the diet.<br /><br />The only caution we would make on this food is that the high protein and calcium content may make it suitable for adult dogs only, particularly in the case of large breeds.\"<br /><br />***On the best brands list at[...]\n",

      "First I had the wild salmon and ordered it a few times in a row, till they decided to bump it up in price over 50% (from 11 something to 17 something) I don't like the Wild Salmon one enough to suddenly go from paying less than $2 a can to nearly $3, though it's surprisingly good. By comparison this tuna and noodle tastes \"off\" tinny or something just not right with the taste. I took a few bites and took a break - then took a few more bites and disposed of most of the can. I cannot recommend the tuna and noodles at all. Blech...\n",

The \"lime\" in this was horridly instense, very vinegar like. It is really all you can taste.

      "I bet you're wondering with such an ingredients list how a pet food could be less than exceptional. The truth is, Chicken Soup for the Cat Lovers' Soul is a great food to feed your cat, but maybe not ideal.<br /><br />I have tested several different pet foods on my felines (everything from Special Kitty to Innova). We have three beautiful cats, a Calico DSH, a Blue Russian, and a beautiful Persian. I have found some pros and cons to Chicken Soup.<br /><br />First off, the ingredients are fantastic, no doubt. From fresh Turkey to spinach and blueberries, the list is sure to impress any conscious shopper. I have no problem feeding this food, if it were simply for the ingredients alone, and at at least a dollar cheaper and a pound more than the nearest competition, it really seems like a great deal up front.<br /><br />Our cats love the taste of it and most any cat I've encountered has never refused this food. They love it.<br /><br />My cons with Chicken Soup is that all of our felines develop a deficiency of vitamin E, obviously noted in their coats. With other foods, their coat is silky, shiny, and just a joy to pet. When we switch to Chicken Soup, their coats feel firmer, rougher, and more matted. Their eyes are not as bright. We've tried this switch a couple of times and it happens each time we switch to Chicken Soup.<br /><br />And even though our cats adore the taste of Chicken Soup, their energy levels aren't quite as competent as normal, compared to when they are being fed holistic, grain-free foods (Taste Of The Wild, Blue, Innova)<br /><br />So to wrap it up,<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />Value<br />Wonderful, fresh ingredients<br />Cats love the taste<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />Grains<br />Vitamin deficient<br />Decrease in energy level and coat texture<br /><br />Also, the ingredients list on Amazon.com is no longer applicable.

I ate these overseas years ago and every time I traveled to Europe, I would bring home a stash.  I found that Amazon now carries them, so I am in heaven.

Amazon will ship 4 bags at a time at an interval that I specify (in our case, once per month), until I cancel, and discounts the price as well.

He figured out how to lift the doors to get at the tennis ball, but when he goes to grab it, it ends up rolling back into the trunk and over to another hole.  Then he just gets irritated.  It slides easily on the hardwood floor, so he ends up pushing it around the room trying to get the ball out.  We put it on a rug to keep it from sliding around and then the doors don't open as easily.  I'm going to try to put some rubber slip grip stuff on the bottom to see if that helps keep it in place on the hardwood floor better.  He tries to dig the tennis ball out of the top opening since the doors don't work too well and then he ends up knocking the whole top portion off.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "Ok, while I didn't like this one as well as Davidson's other peach offerings, I did think it was decent, and totally drinkable.  And this is coming from someone who doesn't really like tea, but is trying to develop a taste for it.<br /><br />The overall taste of this tea is a bitterness slightly spiced.  I didn't really taste the peach at all, but that was ok.  It was a good kind of bitterness, one that combined with the actual heat of the drink warmed you up and it was very calming.  The spices were hard to identify if you don't look at the package, but they reminded me of winter and fall, and getting ready to settle into the harvest.  The same kind of spices you would find in a cookie.  Although the clove did really stand out.<br /><br />The ingredients are good in this tea.  Organic black tea, organic orange peel, organic cinnamon and organic cloves with some natural flavor.  So almost everything was organic, which I wasn't expecting, but was pleasantly surprised by.  I do have to say the orange peel surprised me, I would have never guessed it was in there.  But I was a little disappointed peach wasn't actually listed, which is probably why I didn't taste it.  And the one teabag was sufficient enough for a large mug of tea after steeping for several minutes.  I added no sweetener to the tea either.<br /><br />A nice tea by Davidson's but not my favorite.  Still, the ingredients alone make it worth getting.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012\n",

Be sure to read up on the benefits of raw coconut oil, and remember, never put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat. I'm actually a raw vegan, so this is a big staple for me. I love massaging sea salt and coconut oil into raw kale salad. Add ginger, cayenne, a bit of tamari, and a squeeze of lemon. Healthy and delicious! If you aren't a raw vegan, but you just want to eat healthier, try replacing all your regular oils and butter with raw coconut oil. Coconut has a much higher tolerance for heat before it becomes harmful to the body. It's way more tasty than butter or any kind of butter substitute too.\n",

      "I like the concept of an instant coffee....\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "I picked up a package of Via out of curiosity. For the record, I am the owner of a coffee roastery and a cafe which has won \"Coffee Bar of the Year\" for the past 4 years in CT. We roast coffee for other cafes as well so I feel I have a pretty good grasp of what a good coffee should taste like. Here's my impression of Via:<br /><br />It is certainly easy to prepare. I generally drink a 16oz coffee so I used 2 packets (they are sized for an 8oz serving) to prepare my cup. The coffee is ready to drink as soon as it is stirred.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black and what I taste is only the coffee (my preference for brewing water is a neutral pH of 7, a Langelier Index of zero and no chlorine, fluoride, or lime).<br /><br />On to the coffee:  A good Colombian should be very balanced, with good body, brightness* and a nutty flavor. Truth be told, most Colombian coffee on the market is a bit boring, and most are at best a simply decent, clean cup with almost no aftertaste. Unfortunately this is only true if it's fresh** from a roaster which is unlikely.<br />The Via Colombian that I tried might have started out as an Arabica coffee from the low end of the Specialty Coffee spectrum. Since I don't know the timeline for production, it is very difficult to say how old the coffee was to begin with but there is definitely a \"woody\" note that I associate with aged beans. The actual flavor might not be terrible if you where able to separate out this woody note but unfortunately Via has a very objectionable mouth feel and aftertaste. After a few seconds, there is a very noticeable residue left on your tongue that is bitter and astringent. I typically associate this with a brew that has had coffee grounds siting in it such as when a coffee filter collapses while brewing.<br /><br />Bottom line for me: I would drink it only if my only other choice was a widely available and well known \"donut\" shop coffee (which I am mystified why anyone would drink...just terrible). As for the flavored versions of Via, I am really not a fan of ANY flavored coffee since these flavorings are typically unhealthy and serve mostly to mask the objectionable tastes of the coffee. I drink coffee because I like the flavor. This was my second tasting of Via. I tried it when it was first released in 2009 and was hoping to see an improvement but my notes from that tasting are very similar. I really think that a high end instant is a good idea, but unfortunately for me, Via misses the mark.<br /><br />For a quick and relatively convenient cup, I would suggest investing $30 in an \"AeroPress\" made by Aerobie and widely available. Armed with a freshly roasted coffee from your local micro roaster, you get a tasty, easy to prepare cup, and a very simple cleanup..<br /><br />* We use the descriptive term \"acidity\" to describe brightness. This is not to be confused with the often heard term \"acidic\" which people lament about a coffee that upsets their stomachs. This is thought of by many people in the industry to be the result contamination of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, molds, fungus, and other contaminants often found in non-specialty grade coffee. We believe that most of these complaints would disappear simply by trying a better quality coffee.<br />** Fresh = less than two weeks from roasting. Most coffee is WAY beyond this timeline....\n",

I immediately switched them back to Science Diet.  I contacted the company and asked if they knew what could have casued this digestive upset - they responded that the numerous protein sources were probably the cause.  So maybe boston terriers don't do well with this type of premium dog food.  I would recommend you purchase a small bag first, in case it doesn't work out.\n",

      "Well, what's to be said other than I really like this Licorice Spice Tea?<br /><br />I cut out sugar and reduced my caffeine intake over the last year or so and this licorice tea is my favorite replacement for a caffeinated hot drink. Because I have a sweet tooth I usually now drink tea and coffee with soy milk to reduce the bitterness. This licorice spice tea is delicious and I drink it equally happily both with and without soy milk (the licorice gives it a natural sweet flavor). I have at least one or two cups a day, and even if I was to return to my previous high regime of caffeination I would still include a cup or two of this tea during the day.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of chamomile and this Licorice spice tea does not seem to list that as an ingredient.<br /><br />It seems many people don't like the flavor of licorice, but those that do really like this tea.<br /><br />I've found that the flavor of each batch seems to vary in intensity and the last batch I bought had a less strong taste which simply means it needs to be steeped a little longer.<br /><br />Scratching around for other things to say, my only concern about Stash teas is what appears to be plastic coated aluminum sashes that the teabags are sealed in. That does a great job in terms of sealing in flavor, but I'd rather it wasn't either plastic or aluminum coated. Maybe there's no good alternative.<br /><br />The only other thing is that the latest boxes have changed the design of the semi-circular hole at the bottom of the box and the new design makes it near impossible to easily remove a sachet. You'll be attacking it with the scissors or opening the box lid to get them out.<br /><br />But what really matters is the flavor and this is simply the best!\n",

They are a little expensive i think, 30 cents per treat even at this great Amazon price of $10 (at Petco even the non Hextra version is $22!) but it's a great treat because of the 10% chlorhexidine coating. I don't give them to him every day because of the high percentage of the antiseptic ingredient, even though everything i've read indicates that is not at all harmful for doggies. I give him a half of 1 every other day.<br /><br />Other rawhide treats have made my dog throw up but he has never had any issues with these. Love them.<br /><br />I do have 2 gripes though. 1 is that one of the ingredients is maltodextrin, it's a chemical used in sugar substitutes, which is another reason i don't give him these daily. 2ndly, I always prefer my dogs treats made in the U.S., but these ones are \"A product of Mexico\".<br /><br />Even though my dog naturally accumulates plaque and tartar and an unbelievable fast rate, with the regimen i have in place he's doing well. I will always include these in my regimen unless something better comes along.<br /><br />Keep in mind, doggy dental chews cannot replace brushing. Pet dental gels can if brushing is not an option, special water additives and even the plaqueoff powder, but these chews are great for maintenance. I also have Chlorhexidine tooth wipes for dogs, i only use them 2x a week, i brush his teeth every other day and use dental gel on days i don't brush or wipe the teeth.\n",

      "Having once been a twenty one year old student on a budget living in Tokyo Japan, I've eaten my share (and more )of wholesome, filling curry. From the two hundred yen plates under the railroad tracks, to twenty-two hundred yen plates at posh Tops Saxon, I know good curry (and bad curry) when I taste it. In general, when making curry at home, I tend to stick with Japanese brands (like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ITQAK\">S&B - Golden Curry Sauce Mix - Mild 3.5 Oz.</a>) that require a big pot and lots of cooking time, so Prima Taste's rendang offering looked interesting to me, not only because I'm partial to southeast Asian curries that use fruit, coconut, and such, but also because it looked like it would not be hard to cook. And it wasn't. I browned about a pound and a half of cut up top broil and steak (mixed) and just for kicks threw in two small potatoes and two small carrots. This rendang comes with two pouches. One is a super fine coconut powder, and the other is a traditional red chili based curry paste. Mix the two with a little water, bring to a boil, add the meat, and you're ready to throw it over noodles, rice, potatoes, whatever. I added some extra water and cooked mine for a little over an hour, and the meat got very tender and tasty. The potatoes and carrots were good and soft too. The flavor of the curry is just right. It's punchy but not scorchingly hot, and the coconut adds just the right consistency and flavorful edge. Over rice, it had the perfect balance of flavor and sauciness, and with the extra tender meat, a smooth and satisfying mouth feel. I think what helps make this curry so good is the ingredients are kept separate, vacuum packed, and the paste itself is not dried. It makes for easy prep and a very tasty meal. At $6.50 a box or so, it seems a little pricey, but it makes enough to feed a family of four, or a couple for one night with microwavable lunches for two the next day. I'm definitely going to pick up some more of this stuff at the first opportunity. It's really good.\n",

I love Barry Farms selection but they are slow in getting their products to you, and although their quality is good they tack on quite a bit of shipping, but if you can't find what you want anywhere else with less shipping, Barry Farms has a good selection and like I said their quality is good. I will pass on amaranth flour next time though as I could even taste the amaranth flour in my flour mixes.  It had a strong flavor and smell, one that I couldn't get past, so I threw it out.  I'll stick to all my other gluten free flours that I really like and there are others that have good nutritive value as well like quinoa flour.\n",

I searched the web , read reviews and finally gave in and headed to a local liquor store in hopes of satisfying my craving.<br /><br />I was VERY disappointed. The first sip was horrible... I tried it along with my dinner and it was just as bad. It's  like very flat VERY old Baby juice. It has no flavor AT ALL it is cheap but not even worth the $8.00 i paid for it.<br /><br />I wish i had better news for all the expectant moms out there missing that glass of wine with dinner....

Because I have a heartbeat irregularity, and have been advised to go off caffeine, I was looking for something that tastes OK and doesn't have caffeine.  I am a real coffee hound, and would sip it all day.  The Teeccino blend doesn't smell much like coffee, and it tastes a little like the Postum I used to drink more than 15 years ago--kind of sweet.  I find a gently rounded tablespoon of it for two 8 oz. cups of water in a drip coffee maker is just right for me.  Any more and the flavor is overpowering.  I think I'll be ordering a second batch of three bags plus something else from Amazon that will put me over the $25 order mark and qualify for free shipping and handling.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "This is a very nice, versatile item in Jyoti's lineup. I had this for lunch today with a peas/carrot/corn organic veggie combo mixed in, and it was tasty and filling.<br /><br />Here's my opinion: The heat/hotness level (ie, the heat) is about mediumish. Maybe a bit to the mild side of medium. But it does have some heat, so know that. It's got good spicing, so it packs a flavor punch. There is a lovely creaminess, a thick creaminess, so you can water it down (as I do) to make soup or you can leave it thick to pour over rice or use naan to sop it up.<br /><br />My only critique is that the dumplings are not very dumplingey as I have previously experienced \"dumplingness\". They are, if I had to describe the texture/taste, like tiny baked potatoes. As if you cooked dumpling sized potatoes to a nice soft-firmness. But that's it. Like chunks of potato, not like dumplings (which I've had as airy and as chewy, depending).<br /><br />Since this is essentially just the potatoes and spiced milky-creamy base,  you can vary this in many ways by adding meats, veggies, thinning with milk or water, or topping with crispy bits (baked pita, croutons, etc) or bacon or cheese. Very versatile. This would totally rock with chicken pieces and peas, which is what I'll be making next with the Karhi. I will also try with spinach mixed in.<br /><br />For those watching their weight, this whole can is less than 300 calories worth of damage. :) And each serving has 70 calories (a can is four servings).<br /><br />This is the second Jyoti product offered on Amazon that I've tried. I think both are quite nice, and I will try their lentils with vegetables next. A high quality canned/convenience food for those who like Indian cuisine.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "I did not realize when I had these sent to me that they were for a pod brewer.  I am glad that is that case, however.  It gave me a chance to test these out in several ways.<br /><br />1. Single Cup Pod Brewer- made weak coffee and it just didn't taste very good,  Tasted burned, weak and unimpressive - the price is outrageous for this quality of coffee.<br /><br />2.  Opened bags and used four of them to brew an 8 cup load in the Bunn Phase Brew 8 Cup coffee maker with the Bunn filter.  The result?  A FANTASTIC cup of coffee.  A medium roast coffee, there is a smoothness with a slightly grassy flavor and almost touch of flowery finish.  This is clearly a low-acid coffee which again was very enjoyable.  This made the perfect strength coffee and we all enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />3.  Aerobie Coffee Press- again made excellent smooth coffee very similar to the flavor of the Bunn brewed cup - with even more silky smooth texture.  I used one pod for one cup of coffee, but I opened it first and used it with the Aerobie Espresso Coffee Press.  Using one pod (opened up and used loose) makes a good small cup of coffee, but to make it stronger, two pods were necessary.<br /><br />There are about 3 Tablespoons of ground coffee per bag.<br /><br />All in all, when used loose, this is a really wonderful cup of coffee.  At the price that it is, however, it is ridiculously expensive.  If they took the Marley name off of it, perhaps they could lower the price down and sell it in loose foil bags, better pods of coffee, or un-ground beans foil packed.<br /><br />As dumb as this may sound, there is not one bit of information about this coffee on the box or the foil envelopes.  There are no instructions whatsoever. If someone had never used a pod coffee maker or heard of one, they might not understand this process at all.  Surely they should have SOMETHING on the box and packets saying that these are only to be used with pod coffee makers.<br /><br />Again, it might sound fussy, but not everyone knows everything, and it would help to avoid mistaken purchases for someone who has no idea what a pod is for coffee.  As you can see from some reviews, the tea style bag is easily misunderstood and used in a fashion like making tea.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "Brewing Machine: Philips Senseo<br /><br />First thing I noticed was that the packet contained noticeably more coffee than my Senseo pods.  I thought great, I can use just one to brew my double serving cup.  Wrong, very weak when brewed that way.<br /><br />Second, tried to brew two servings at once, but two pods were much too large to fit in the two serving Senseo pod holder.  So, I used the single pod holder and brewed one cup at a time.  What a hassle.<br /><br />Taste wise, the coffee is okay, it tases sort of weak for my tastes and doesn't have a lot of flavor, and the price per pod you might as well buy Star Bucks (or favorite coffee house coffee).  I will keep using my Senseo dark roast pods which I think have better flavor and are much cheaper.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES<br /><br />When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, \"100 calorie packs\" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + \"ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS\" & \"ARTIFICIAL COLORS\" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history.\n",

This might bother some people.  I store them in a plastic zip lock so they will stay fresh.  The filtering process through a filter rather than the plastic housing might be what makes it taste so good or it may just be the coffee.  It is much less expensive at $13.59 per 36 than the typical K-cups as well as being the best tasting coffee.  I love the French Roast.\n",

The best solution I found was to switch to a grain free food, and offer more wet food than dry, so he will have more moisture in his bowels. I switched to Natural Care LDT, and it solved his problem...for about six months. After finding another steaming pile in my bed recently, and a few under my desk, I decided to try BFF, as my local pet store  just started carrying it. He is a picky feline, but he sucked the Tuna and pumpkin flavor down like a Hoover. One week later, happy cat, no more poop in my bed, which means happy girl.

      "------------------\n",
      "I had to get medical therapy to increase my milk supply for twins. Fenugreek was prescribed and it made a huge difference. Based on what the doctor told me you can try the following if you have twins or simply need to increase your milk supply:<br /><br />* Fenugreek is very helpful, 2 capsules three times a day with meals, eventually working your way up to 4 capsules per meal. The body gets used to it after a while so the doctor suggested going off it for a couple of days and restarting.<br /><br />* Nurse 8-12x a day, putting each baby to breast until they empty it (do not time it) - the baby is much more effective than the pump at drawing the milk out than even a hospital pump, and will help increase your supply. In effect, interrupting the feeding could be counterproductive.<br /><br />* You can decrease the # of sessions if the amount pumped is more than 1000 ml/ 24 hrs (try pumping instead of nursing for one day to measure). You can also try weighing the baby to calculate intake, using a baby scale in grams (same as mls for calculating). Note - this will be a rough estimate as the baby may be getting more milk than the pump - and some women are unable to pump much even if they can nurse well.<br /><br />* Alternate sides for the babies, as one may have a stronger suck. It's possible one side will have a lot more milk than another. How you hold the baby also affects supply - if you're right handed that side will hold the baby more firmly and they may nurse longer and increase supply more on that side. All normal.<br /><br />* After breastfeeding the baby, pump but only for 5 minutes or so to increase demand on your body and thus milk production. Frequency is much more important than duration. Pumping for 20 min has little effect according to the doctor (I know, \"now I find out?!\" that's what I said)<br /><br />* If you have twins, read the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976896931\">Mothering Multiples: Breastfeeding and Caring for Twins or More! (La Leche League International Book)</a> by Karen Kerkhoff Gromada. I wish I had read this early on. It provides solid advice on breastfeeding multiples plus a whole lot more up to 2 yrs of age.<br /><br />* Try to eat well and sleep at least 6 hrs. Your milk production is directly related to your health and stress levels.<br /><br />* If you're able to breastfeed exclusively great but if you can't don't beat yourself up over it it's Ok to supplement (we used Enfacare as my babies were low weight, then Enfamil Premium for one and Alimentum for our other). You have a lot on your hands to worry about.<br /><br />* Don't try to do all feedings alone, you'll go crazy. Have your hubby do the last feeding of the night 10 or 11 pm and the early morning one (6 or 7 am) - you do the ones in between. This way, you'll each get a solid chunk of sleep. The one who's not \"on shift\" stays in the quiet bedroom without a monitor but with a cell phone. We had an extra bed in the nursery so it would be easier to nurse the babies - if I needed help (two babies crying at the same time or you're too tired) I'd call my hubby on the cell phone, but this rarely happens if you stage feedings (always feed twin A first for example). My hubby comes in at 6 am or whenever and quietly feeds the babies before they wake up so I can sleep until 8 or so.<br /><br />* I kept my energy and supply up with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQDDYE\">Ensure Plus - Vanilla</a> and oatmeal.<br /><br />* Google \"manual expression Stanford University\", the video shows how to increase your milk supply significantly using manual expression. It works better than any other method even if it feels unusual.<br /><br />* If you do supplement and trying to increase breastfeeding, don't stop bottle feeding cold turkey (you may not have enough milk supply as supplementing may lower supply). Continue to supplement and give 1 oz or so BEFORE starting to nurse. The reason for this is that bottlefed babies are used to a faster flow and ready supply, with nursing it takes longer for the milk to let down. Giving the bottle-fed baby some formula before nursing will take the edge off his hunger and keep him from \"chomping away at the bit\" if you will - in other words it will calm him down and make the nursing experience more relaxing for mom & baby and allow baby to nurse longer.<br /><br />* Try a brief warm shower or use warm compresses (try putting warm water in a diaper) before nursing to stimulate milk let down.<br /><br />* Keep your eyes off the clock. Another reason to not interrupt or time breast feeding - the hind milk that lets down after the baby has been nursing a while is richer and higher in fat, more satisfying for the baby. If you stop after \"X\" minutes you may not get the hind milk.<br /><br />* Continue nursing 8-12x a day - don't wait too long before feedings (4+ hrs), any sign of engorgement is letting your body know there's less demand and will reduce milk production. Nursing every 2-3 hours is better, allow a stretch of 4 hours early in your sleeping cycle to feel better rested (have your hubby feed baby late at night).<br /><br />* Pump for a few minutes each time you nurse to simulate increased demand and boost milk production. Manual milk expression and fenugreek will also help and over time you'll need to supplement less as your milk production increases.<br /><br />* Don't do marathon pumping. As soon as you start feeling stressed or find yourself wondering how many ounces you've pumping, etc. you're overthinking things and this will affect your milk supply. Stop for a few minutes and go do something else. Then pump a little more. You can leave it out at room temperature while you do this - mark the time you started & date on tape w/ a Sharpie pen to be safe. If you wait 15-30 min or so, it counts as an additional pumping session (if you're trying to fit more in).<br /><br />* Pumping is not always a good indicator of your real milk supply (some women may not be able to pump much but nurse well) - a baby scale is the most accurate measurement if you really want to know (don't stress this too much, just nurse until baby seems full).<br /><br />* Feed on demand and expect cluster feeding (every 1-2 hrs) at the witching hour and just before a growth spurt.<br /><br />* For me at least I always had to supplement with twins because I never had enough milk for two. I did see a huge increase in my milk supply from very little to being able to nurse one baby full time for a while. Fenugreek was a HUGE help.<br /><br />Lastly, this tip from a sleep doctor - to handle sleep deprivation log how many hours total you slept at night (even if interrupted), find the midway point and add 12 hours. Try to take a 30-60 minute nap then, this is your natural down-time according to your inner clock and will be much better than trying to catch up on sleep on the weekends (example - slept 12am -6 am, midway point is 3 am add 12 hrs - try to nap @ 3 pm.) Keep a log of how long you sleep each time - always try to get at least 6 hrs.<br /><br />With Fenugreek, enough sleep, a good diet and the tips above, your milk supply should increase.\n",

      "I was a little worried about buying a bonsai tree, sight unseen, especially since it was to be a Christmas gift for a very good friend. Needless worry! The bonsai tree was perfect; its branches were a deep green, it was planted in a black ceramic bonsai dish and included a rock. It had been packaged very well so that the soil was still damp and no branches injured during transport. The company included a sheet of very helpful instructions and a free bottle of liquid fertilizer. It's always nice to do business with a company that cares about its products, and this company certainly does.\n",

Once you start eating, you just cannot stop.<br />  The licorice wheels are just the REAL THING and have been around in Europe forever - around 100 years.  Quality and taste ... through and through. Many licorice/gummi producers have been trying to imitate HARIBO... but no other brand comes even close!!!  The wheels are chewy with a medium licorice flavor....not too sweet and not too salty.  Besides that, you can have fun with them by peeling them apart into many different strings.<br />  And to find HARIBO at Amazon.com is just as wonderful - the price cannot be beat.<br />  You  do not pay taxes, no shipping charges and then delivery directly to your place . . . what a bargain!<br />  Keep those wonderful HARIBO products coming, Amazon.<br />  Your grateful customer.\n",

As with many things, coffee is a matter of personal taste. I don't like the bitter flavor of Starbucks, for example, which is the result of their trademark roast. I like flavorful coffe that is not bitter. I loved this coffee from Melitta.<br /><br />It is complex and rich, very european in flavor and not bitter at all. It is surely one of my personal favorites. At any given time I have 6 to 8 coffee varieties at home (both whole beans and ground), yet I find myself choosing this Melitta coffee every time and I am not getting tired of it.

      "So I have a confession to make. I don't like pina coladas...or getting caught in the rain, for that matter. They're too sickeningly sweet filled with tropical flavors built to give me heartburn. I love fresh pineapple, but when I wasn't on meds to help fight my acid reflux, even looking at one was enough to send me into heartburn agony for a few hours. But now I can indulge and it's wonderful! Anyway, yes, I don't like pina coladas because of the creaminess as well, so I'm glad they released a pineapple matcha as well as a pina colada matcha. Pineapple I can definitely get behind. We love pineapple in this house, my wife spent some time in Mexico and fell in love with them there. We even have one of those pineapple corer/slicers, a big piece of $10 equipment with a single purpose that I refuse to live without.  I am very excited to be trying this matcha and I'm praying it will help feed in to that pineapple addiction we've found ourselves with. Maybe I'll try it swirled together with some strawberry matcha...I love the taste of pineapples and strawberries together.  Or any of the berries, for that matter. They just balance each other out so beautifully.<br /><br />So after a bit of mental back and forth, I decided to give this one a go. Pineapple can be done well in teas, so hopefully this one will live up to expectations. When I first mixed it up, my wife could smell it from across the room. \"That has to be bubble gum or cotton candy.\" Nope, just pineapple! It does smell very sweet. At first sip, I'd be hard-pressed to find pineapple specifically, more of an overall tropical candy flavor with a touch of a medicinal aftertaste, like chewable baby aspirin. But in the aftertaste, the taste that lingers on your tongue, I found pineapple. Yum, yum, yum pineapple. I'm not too sure of this one, I'm going to have to try it with strawberry, but it's got all of the sweetness of pineapple and none of the tartness that makes it so good. I don't think this is one I'll be stocking up on, but I don't think I'll be forcing it on my friends either. I won't have any trouble finishing it, but I doubt I'll get more. Still, I am grateful to have been granted the chance to try it! I just don't think I'm enough of a tropical fruit fan to fully enjoy it.\n",

I was pleasantly shocked at how fantastic they really are.<br /><br />Normally i would order the Vesuvio blend from Batdorf and Bronson which is a great espresso blend but, runs almost twice the price for 32 oz of beans. The Appassionato though cheaper and also the fact that for about 60% of the Batdorf price i get a little more weight in beans, is superior by far.  It is very smooth and clean, grinds wonderfully and it provides a wonderful crema.<br /><br />We use a gaggia carezza machina and a breville conical burr grinder (not the greatest burr grinder but, it does the job well enough).\n",

So my point is, before diving into buying a big bag from hearing only positive reviews, try buying a smaller bag to test it b/c all dogs have different taste.

He threw up big pieces that looked like they were finely cut with a sharp knife. Almost as if it were knife cut segments that were glued together.This should not happen with a Bravo stick. I will never buy a bully stick from this retailer at Amazon again. I question if this really is a Bravo product. It does not appear to be natural. After 8 hrs in his stomach it is totally undigested.\n",

Marley's One Love Organic Coffee, though, was a nice change of pace for me.  It has a very mild flavor (I detected no bitterness myself) that may not have enough punch for some folks, but for an afternoon break it is perfect for me.<br /><br />I removed this coffee from the filter pods it comes in and filtered it myself in my own coffee drip pot.  I used two pods for sixteen ounces of coffee and it came out wonderful.  I actually enjoyed just sitting down on a lazy afternoon to watch the world fly by for a few minutes while drinking this coffee.  I know it sounds a bit strange, but the coffee actually relaxed and calmed me down.<br /><br />I recommend this coffee for folks who enjoy a quick break once in awhile.

      "------------------\n",
      "This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various \"high end\" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the \"Before Grain\" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy \"Duck a l'orange\" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a \"treat\" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing \"Made in Thailand\" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.\n",

So instead I ground it up in my new coffee grinder and added it to yogurt, YUM... the earthy flavor is gone and a nutty wholesomeness is added to my yogurt.  I add it to everything and it makes a great addition to my healthy diet.  The seeds look fresh, clean and healthy.  They almost looked too perfect with a nice shiny shell.  The freshly ground meal smells very clean and definitely has a nice nutty bite.  There is about more or less a year on the expiration date on the package that I received.  I would recommend this specific product to anyone who wants to add a bit of health to their daily diet.

      "I was first exposed to Keurig-made coffee at a luxury hotel and ran out (to Amazon) and bought a B70.  I have since purchased about a dozen Keurigs for friends and family.  Here is what has tempered my enthusiasm; they don't hold up over time.  I don't expect things to last forever but most of the people that I have given the Keurig to only get about two years of use out of them before their pumps fail.  I replaced my B70 with a Breville and it just recently passed away.<br /><br />Before I let myself calculate just how much money that I have spent on an \"easy\" way to make a cup of coffee I purchased this unit.  Overall I am very pleased with it.  It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles of my other K-cup coffee makers, but it's got enough of the features that I need (however, I do miss the clock.). One thing that is really nice is that it has a drain feature, something missing from my other Keurigs.  This allows one to drain the unit of the water that is deep inside the machine, preparing it for transport or storage.<br /><br />The one real feature that caused me to buy this model over the others will take a while to prove itself, and that is DURABILITY.  Being designed for office use the B145 is supposed to have a more durable pump.  I have to admit that I am skeptical, but we will see and I will update this review periodically.<br /><br />Update:  4/16/12  I have used this machine several times a day, every day, since I wrote this review and it is still performing fine.

The popular dark (Italian) and mild (Colombian) flavors are offered in very classy looking plastic pouches that conveniently turn 8oz of hot water into the best tasting instant coffee you've ever had. In fact, I had a difficult time telling it from their brewed coffee, and normally that's all I ever buy there. Although the price is a bit high - almost a $1 a cup - it's still a great alternative when you just can't find a walk-in store. I see a few packets taking cross-country flights with me, as well as stuffing a handful into my backpack when I camp. Heck, I'll never have to drink hotel-room coffee again! Hey Starbucks - when can I expect a \"decaf\" version?\n",

I remember when my mom made fudge it would occasionally turn out grainy and she said it was because the humidity caused the sugar in the candy to crystalize. I don't know if that is the case with this fudge or not, but both this and another Gardiners of Scotland fudge I bought have the same graininess. Further the flavors were odd. The Rum and Raisin was ok, but the raisins had no flavor. The apple and cinnamon didn't taste like apple or cinnamon nor did the strawberry and cream taste like strawberries. I think there was one ginger flavored piece in the can and it was flavorless. I won't be buying Gardiners of Scotland fudge again.\n",

I've tried the mixed nuts they sell locally, which have a lot of peanuts mixed in, and the difference in quality is pretty noticeable. These are much firmer, fresher, and just taste overall better. It seems the filler nut they used here were almonds, which is fine, and certainly better then peanuts, but it's unfortunate that pecans are scarce. Brazil nuts are pretty generously packed in as well, with moderate amounts of hazelnut (Filbert) and cashew. You get a lot of salt near the bottom, naturally, but otherwise there's just enough mixed in to assure that they stay flavorful from the moment you open them.<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone looking for a mixed nut snack.

I've tried non-fat dry milk to save room in my refrigerator --but the taste is AWFUL!  I've tried to substitute sweetened condensed milk, (too sweet), and 1/2 and 1/2, (which needs refrigeration -- but not that much room in the refrigerator.  OK -- but no Vitamin D!  Nido Instant Dry Whole Milk Powder, though expensive, seemed just want I wanted -- and, though expensive, is not as expensive as buying a new refrigerator!<br /><br />The taste of NIDO is much better than non-fat dry milk.  And for most purposes, works quite well.  But somehow, when I try to use it with coffee -- and Splenda -- the sweetness of the Splenda is lessened.  I like sweet coffee -- but putting 3 or 4 times my usual amount of Splenda to achieve the sweetness I like in coffee could be dangerous.<br />(My doctor has already told me to cut down, as too much Splenda seems to be bad for the liver.) I suspect that the LECITHIN in NIDO is what gets in the way of the sweetness, as lecithin is NOT found in most liquid whole milks, (that I know of, anyway).  So my advice would be to use NIDO in anything that does not require too much sweetness, (sweentess from Splenda, and/or sucralose, at any rate.)  But if you don't require too much sweetness in your coffee, it's OK to use, I guess.  And it can always be used, if an emergency strikes and your refrigerator stops working.\n",

My problem: there is nothing about this cereal to justify the high price!  The flavor is just flat - they didn't even substitute the signature malt flavoring with some rice malt syrup.  This has got to be made nearly as cheaply as regular rice krispies - I feel like many companies slap on a \"gluten free\" label and think that justifies a hefty price.  (Kudos to the Chex brand for NOT doing this.)  I don't buy many convenience foods and I don't allow my kids to eat cereal very often so I will probably only buy these on special occasions when we want Rice Krispies Treats - the real deal, because I haven't found a single \"health food\" version of crispy rice cereal that has that same crispy (not crunchy,) airy, slightly flattened shape and texture that really make a good crispy treat.\n",

      "The product consists of an approximately 10 inch (25 cm) long piece of meat with 1 or 2 smaller (approx 1 1/2-2 inches, 3-5 cm) pieces thrown in.  The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package.  Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt).  It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather.  I appreciate the fact that the pepper bits are not \"loose\" like some other jerkies, so crumbs are not much of a concern.

      "Lickety Stik is an interesting idea. It's a small bottle filled with a thick brown liquid - a liquified dog treat, essentially - which you can squeeze out and smear over the top (sort of like gel deodorant). Your dog, I guess, is then supposed to lick this as a treat, but unfortunately my dog was just confused. I was still able to dab the liquid on his paw, and he seemed to like that quite a bit. So it still works for me to some extent.<br /><br />The big issue, I think, is that I'm not sure what the practical use of this product is. Maybe it's convenient for training; instead of carrying a bag of treats, you can just pop this thing in your pocket. Or I suppose if you have an elderly dog who has trouble with solids, it might come in handy. Otherwise it seems more convenient for me (and probably for many others) to stick with the dry treats.\n",

It performs poorly, the brew color out of the auto-grind espresso machine I have quits rather too quickly. That prompts an adjustment to use less water, which means I have to do more brew cycles to fill a cup, three instead of two. That kinda kills the savings.<br /><br />This bean works very well for blended drinks, since the lighter flavor doesn't become overpowering when blended with ice, milk and sugar.<br /><br />I ate a few beans and they had this immature taste, not full-bodied coffee, like a burnt pinto bean taste. It seems like they got a supplier that includes a higher percentage of immature beans (not fully ripened when picked) which tens to roast into a lighter color than the rest. Either the picking machine's driver did not adjust to prevent picking the immature beans, or they decidedly had it set to increase yield at the sacrifice of the quality.<br /><br />Only using this one for iced coffee drinks.\n",

Instead of a circle with a hole in the middle they are squares with little indention's (they kind of look like Halls cough drops) so you get more candy for your buck.  They also have more flavors, off the top of my head in addition to the typical flavors there's green apple, orange, and strawberry (maybe a few more different ones). And the 3rd best thing, they're individually wrapped, which makes it easier to carry a few around in your pocket and insure they don't get dirty.  Really not sure why these things haven't aren't more popular, much better than Lifesavers in terms of pocket candy.\n",

Neither flavor smelled bad.  The chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny, but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice.  I've feed my cats a few cans of each flavor, and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food.  Their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well.  I've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats.<br /><br />According to the can's list of ingredients, all the ingredients are natural - no by-products are used.  While the food is not organic, at least the food doesn't use by-products.  No wheat gluten is used either.<br />I went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor.  None of the ingredients come from China, which has a horrible record on food safety.  The cat food is made in  Thailand, but as far as I know, Thailand does not have a poor record of food safety, and Thai people do love their pet cats, I sure Thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food.

They are just hard enough to warrant some good chewing time but will not stain the carpet or leave bad house odors.  The only ONE drawback is just a nature issue....what goes in...must come out.  It does make cleaning the yard much easier since the bright orange sweet potato stands out in the green grass! (too many yams?? LOTS of outside potty time too!)

I've tried a lot more expensive beans, and for about $8 a pound this stuff is really the best for the money that I've tried so far.  Even though the roast is medium, the flavor profile is very robust, and has absolutely none of the smokey, slightly bitter flavors of the over-roasted stuff.  The best way to describe it is like the coffee you would get at a good donut shop, only a lot more flavorful.<br />Don't get me wrong, dark roast coffee has it's place.  I love dark roasts for espresso, but for an everyday brew of good old joe, this is really good stuff.  It's good black and also with cream and sugar.

I switched to an organic human-grade kibble and the kittens were contented after their portions. This told me that the food must have been filling the cats up, but not substantially enough to keep them full. Just as a human could fill up on rice and chicken nuggets and vitamins (the human equivalents of some of the ingredients) and be healthy, but not really feel contented in their bellies.<br /><br />This is less expensive than the organic food I buy them now, but they want to eat more so I don't know what the end cost really is. I like the idea of all of the vitamins in there, just as I would take a multi-vitamin, but I just wish that their bellies could keep full after eating. I probably won't go back to this kibble. I wish I could rate it higher for the vitamins, but these corn meal and by-product ingredient listings really explain my kittens lack of feeling full.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Lots of vitamins<br />* Left fur glossy<br /><br />CONS:<br />* Always begging for more food<br />* Corn meal and chicken by-products near the top of ingredient list (poor quality, not human grade)\n",

      "Pros:<br />Very complex<br />Rich<br />Excellent for doubles and triples<br /><br />Cons:<br />A bit expensive<br />Only adequate for singles<br /><br />Overall:<br />I very much like Black Cat Espresso. I consider it the bar against which other espressos are measured. I like it more than Kicking Horse, Lavazza, and Stumptown. Its flavor profile is very complex. It has its fair share of caramel and chocolate, but it also has a spicy, savory nature to it, and very fruity notes that come out well in singles.<br /><br />This is not a large-scale, homogenized coffee. Different regions and roasts result in different flavors from each bag. Sometimes that spiciness becomes a sort of salty flavor, and the fruits can turn very flowery. It is an easy espresso to make. Even shots that aren't perfect come out tasting pretty good. It's also a forgiving blend in that the shots are not prone to channeling.<br /><br />Singles are good, because any good coffee becomes light and toasty in a single, as opposed to the rich, crema-bombs of doubles and triples. Still, this espresso is very much intended for doubles or triples.<br /><br />In drip coffee, it's alright. And by drip, I mean any immersion process, be it French press, Aeropress, drip, pour-over, etc. The flavors get blown out, with the spices overwhelming the chocolates and caramels and resulting in a coffee that's not terribly smooth. Of the immersion processes, Aeropress tasted the best, probably because it most closely approximates espresso.<br /><br />Black Cat is a bit expensive, but not terribly so. Especially when one considers the increases in coffee as of late, -even Starbucks Tribute was $14 per pound- the price isn't crippling, but it is definitely above many other brands. You can save a little money by buying in five-pound bulks on Intellgentsia's website, but it's not a good idea to keep coffee beans around for that long when you can just as easily get it fresh.<br /><br />All said, Black Cat is espresso that more often than not finds its way into my machine.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Something that I forgot to mention in my initial review is that Black Cat is a very complex blend. That means that cheap stepped grinders WILL NOT grind the coffee correctly for espresso. Some higher-end stepped grinders will do the job, like the Rancilio Rocky, but you'll want a good, stepless grinder to fine-tune the grind. This is especially important if you have an espresso machine that's very picky about grind.<br /><br />Finally, this is not a terribly cremariffic espresso, which means to get a good amount of crema out of it, and thus really have a good canvas for latte art, you're going to have to prepare triples.\n",

He would be hungry at dinner time and when this would be poured in would nibble at it. Or he would eat the wet food and leave this until he was forced to.

It is good for those with animal milk allergies or who are concerned about cruelty to farm animals.  And it is also good for those of us who need to avoid the estrogenic properties of ingesting too many soy products.<br /><br />Great, so it's healthy, but how does it taste?  Well, this hempshake is amazing -- the taste is really great.  I particularly like the chocolate.  And I'm impressed that although it tastes a 1000 times better than plain hemp powder, it only contains 80 calories and 7 grams of sugar.<br /><br />As for digestibility, they do add inulin, which is good for the gut, and I don't have any problem with it.  However, the high amount of fiber might present a problem for those coming straight from a SAD (standard American diet), so you might want to begin slow with a small drink and work up to the full dose.<br /><br />In fact, I'm drinking a Nutiva Hempshake smoothie right now for my breakfast.

I was surprised at how good it was, very close to brewed. I think it's too expensive to substitute for brewed coffee on a daily basis, but if you need an instant coffee occasionally for convenience it's very good.

This tastes like some number crunchers worked on lowering the price per unit to boost the profit margin and marketers worked on bottle material and bottle shape with a test group until it scored a good percentile and voila, you get a processed liquid in a plastic bottle. One of their biggest problems with all of this was that their original customers' palates had only experienced pure CW, so we all knew better. We were used to the good stuff and then our dealer got greedy and cut our coke, I mean our coconut water, and they lost alot of buyers to others dealing the pure stuff. Now I buy ZICO in the 33.8oz tetrapacks. It's the pure stuff.<br /><br />Knowing that ZICO sometimes reads these reviews I'm wondering out loud here if someone inside ZICO, with a sense of taste, just HAS to be saying \"I told you so\" ever since this version was released.

It's especially good for cooking bitter greens like turnips or collards; the coconut taste helps cut the bitterness, giving a marvelous flavor to the greens.<br /><br />I've discovered a fantastic way to make healthy popcorn using VCO. I've tried the stovetop method in the past using olive oil, but it's always burned my pot. What I do now is put a great heaping tablespoon of VCO into my 10-quart Fagor canning pot, melt it at 390 on my induction burner, dump in popcorn kernels to just cover the bottom in a single layer, and put on a glass lid I have that fits the pot. Then I just follow through with the popping process, jiggling the pot a little to keep the unpopped kernels falling to the bottom as the kernels pop. I listen for the popping to slow, just like you do with microwave popcorn, and then just turn off the induction burner and let the pot sit a minute while the last few kernels pop. This makes a wonderfully VCO-coated popcorn that can be enjoyed without salt if necessary, or add just a little fine popcorn salt and toss.\n",

My last dog was a miniature Poodle who ended up late in life with bad teeth and I don't want that happening with my Maltese, so I bought these in hopes that starting early with him would create some good habits.  Well, turns out he loves these chews and treats them as treats!<br /><br />They are just the right size for a small dog - in this case, 5-1/2 lbs and they do not have a bad odor.  In fact, to my nose they don't smell at all.  He recognizes the package and will beg for one, sometimes eating it at one sitting.  Since he's teething, I find it easy to offer one when he's chewing on something from which I want to distract him and it works.  Now if housebreaking would just go so smoothly . . .<br /><br />A friend with an older small poodle verifies that the poodle also likes them.\n",

In fact I prefer it over the sickening sweet alternatives marketed by the food packing giants. With flax seeds it is uber healthy with so many essentials.

I used the \"boiling water\" method which I prefer to micro-waving and let is set for about 10 minutes.  It is \"soupy\" but there was enough texture and bits of veggies to satisfy and I found it filling enough for a lunch.  The only problem I had was the top covering which was hard to peel back and tore apart, so I just covered it with a saucer while \"cooking\" for the 6-10 minutes.<br /><br />The thing I *really* like about the soup is that it is filling, but only 200 calories and 2g of fat. Only 20 calories are from fat. Zero saturated fat or cholesterol.<br /><br />I took away a star for bad product info on the pkg where the values shown look really good until you realize that they consider one cup to be 2 servings, so you have to double all the figures shown.  I found this misleading and questionable.  One cup of soup for two people?  I don't think so.<br /><br />This soup has 620mg of sodium, but lots of vitamin A, so it's a reasonably healthy meal. I also like the Nile Spice soups, they also tend to be high in sodium, but they are honest about it and call out 1 cup as one serving.\n",

The one problem I had was that since I don't have a measuring cup with me at work (who does?) I had to estimate how much water to put in; I filled up to the line at the top of the bowl which I don't think was there for that purpose. Would have been nice if they had just marked the fill line on the side of the bowl. I think I put too much because the soup was barely hot after heating for the indicated ninety seconds.<br /><br />Ingredients: Indicating that it contains tofu is a little disingenuous; mine only had two pieces of tofu and one was half-sized. There were a lot of noodles. Too many noodles really. There weren't enough leafy veggies; mostly the scallions. The ingredients themselves seemed to be fresh and quality though.<br /><br />Taste: So very very bland. Just...amazingly bland. The over-abundance of bland completely tasteless noodles seemed like the main culprit. The only flavor besides bland noodles was scallions. I felt like I was eating scallion noodle water. I kind of feel sick now; there's a lump of oniony noodles just sitting in my stomach.

It was completely edible, but the texture was just not as good as the others.  I think it was the Teriyaki that I didn't like so much, but I really liked the Texas Barbecue and the Hickory Smoked flavors.<br /><br />These are excellent low-calorie, low-fat, convenient, tasty snacks with high amounts of protein.  You can take them anywhere, keep them in your desk at work or in your purse!<br /><br />The only complaint I have about these is that I wish there were versions with lower sodium.  To me, as someone who loves a good salty snack, but knows that too much salt is not good and tries to avoid it, these taste too salty.  And 300+ mg of sodium per strip seems high.<br /><br />But in the end I am overlooking the sodium and am purchasing these in bulk now!  I just bought the Thai Peanut flavor because I love spicy foods, and I love Thai food!  I'll update this review with my thoughts on this flavor after I receive them.<br /><br />UPDATE: I received the Thai Peanut flavor and LOVE them!  They have a great chewy texture, good flavor, and a good amount of spice.  All for only 74 calories each, but 10g protein!  I definitely recommend these!\n",

The chunks are slightly tough, have a pronounced grain, and actually taste something like beef. Having gone through six cans, I have found very little excess fat or gristle.<br /><br />It's pretty easy to whip up a quickie beef stew with this stuff. Frozen veggies, rice or potatoes, a can of diced or stewed tomatoes, some spices and wine, and you have a perfectly serviceable, quickie meal.<br /><br />For those who argue that made from scratch tastes better, you are right.

Are we supposed to add water? I don't know because there are no feeding instructions on the packaging.  I attempted to add some water it didn't reconstitute anything.  The treats remained hard as rocks.  Breaking up the piece into smaller chunks didn't seem to make a difference either.  Plus, the addition of water suddenly made the treats unappealing to my cat.

I did notice that each bag was secured with a hand twist tie rather than a manufactured seal but that in itself did not alarm me. However, when I opened the first bag and poured into a measuring cup, I noticed something irregularly rounded, black and hard go into the my cup. I prayed that it was a darkened kernel...but clearly it was not. When I fished this out (with my bare hand, yuck!)it appeared obvious to me that this was a rodent dropping.  I could be wrong, but I doubt it. It was definitely not a popcorn kernal.<br /><br />I suppose if I had opened any other bag in this shipment the chances of this happening would be small, but I did see it and thus am tossing out the entire order.

What pray tell are you supposed to do with that extra 2/3 cup of mix is beyond me, but i guess that since your getting a 4 pack, they expect you to combine them and make an extra batch.<br /><br />The cakes cook up nice and fluffy: if you use an egg instead of oil (recipe says you can sub one for the other). The one thing i can't seem to get my head around, or fix is that they always seem gritty. I blend them, I wisk them, I puree the batter but the grit is always there.<br /><br />Not nearly the worst part is the metallic after taste, if I wanted to put something in my mouth that tasted like a penny...

I would agree with the other reviews, I noticed maybe three pieces of cashew in this. I thought vegetable korma has raisins in it too, but this doesn't seem to have any. This is actually one of Kitchens of India's lower-calorie offerings -- I wondered how vegetable korma could be low calorie, but now I see it's because it's not creamy the way it is at restaurants. Still, it's decent if you don't expect the same thing you'd order out. Would go well with some basmati rice.\n",

      "The story goes that I adopted a cat from an agency last summer. Having always grown up with dogs and not cats, I went ahead and wandered down to my Target to get a bag of Friskies. About a week later, my kitty (named Sugar) starting vomiting. Confused, I assumed it was the wet food we were feeding her in the morning. So we changed it. Then we changed it again. No results. I took her to the vet and asked. He checked her out and said likely the problem was having a sensitive stomach and he recommended Science Diet. Bam. My cat does great now. She's lost a little bit of weight so she's the right size now. She doesn't vomit anymore. This food works and it works well. I read the negative review here and I would say the problem was unique to the cat. My cat loves it and is doing brilliantly now.\n",

      "I have been taking maca capsules for several months now with no negative side effects, in addition to other supplements, i.e. Vitamin C, B, E & calcium daily.  This morning, I tried 1 tsp of maca powder in a cup of yogurt.  The taste was fairly awful, but I suppose it's an acquired taste based on what I am reading here.  About 20 minutes later, I took half a dropper of sublingual Vitamin B as I normally do in the morning.  Five minutes after that, I became shaky and nauseous & for the next 1 1/2 hours my body did everything it could to rid itself of what I had ingested. Without going into detail, suffice it to say it was not pleasant.  Judging from the other reviews here, however, this is a good product, so I may have just made a huge mistake mixing it with Vitamin B.  I am hoping that is all, but this strong adverse reaction tells me that maca powder definitely does affect your energy level in some way - hence the shakiness.  I have also since read that it is best to start with a smaller dose than is recommended, i.e. 1/4 tsp.  I am in perfect health & physically fit, so I don't have a preexisting condition that would explain my reaction, nor have I ever had a negative reaction to vitamins or other supplements. So......my belief is that this product does work as intended, & for that reason I am giving it 4 stars, but use it with a bit of caution.  If this helps even one person avoid my experience, then it's worth the time to post this.\n",

We gradually tapered off the Nutro and introduced some new stuff. The cats stopped having problems and were no longer vomiting or having loose stools. A couple months down the road our male cat started peeing in different places and wouldn't go in the litter box. We took him to the vet to find out he had a severe UTI and that this had been going on for 2-3 months. We traced it back to about the time we started feeding him this Nutro Indoor Cat formula. I feel this food is to blame for his severe UTI conditions. Perhaps it's not the only culprit, but considering the awful side effects, it might have been the top contributor.<br /><br />Lots of pet owners are disowning Nutro and switching to something with better quality checks.<br /><br />If you are having problems with Nutro, call the company at 1-800-833-5330 and tell them your claim and what is happening to your pet.<br /><br />Here is a link of pet owners with problems with this cat food :<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I no longer feel safe purchasing any type of Nutro cat food for my beloved pets.\n",

Of course, you need to watch your diet and excersize to loose weight, but I can clearly say that this water was helping me loosing weight. Now, it's not the main reason why I drink this. Just like this water, any alkiline(with higher pH) water will be absorbed to you body almost twice as fast as your regular drinking water. When I play basketball, I sweat like a hog. But as soon as I take a sip(full sip) of this water(or any alkiline water), you can feel that your body is sucking that H2O from your stomach as soon as it gets consumed, then you start sweating much more right after.<br /><br />As a health profession, with much knowledge of histology and physiology, it seems like I can picture how my cells are absorbing that H2O(supposedly, polarized due to the high pH) at a very faster rate than regular water. You go to bathroom much more frequently, and I see my urine gets as clear as it can be. I do assume that it will also benefit your kidneys by actively clearing those biproducts(i.e. CO2, etc.) of your body.<br /><br />I know that high price of this water is the main drawback. I go to Costco, and sometime they sell a case of 12 glass bottles at a cheaper price. Recently, Amazon had it avaliable at a very good price, but still anybody will be offended by it's high price over other cheaper bottle waters.<br /><br />Like I said, you get what you can afford, and go with your budget. Still this water is very expensive for me, but I simply cut on my expense on ther beverages like Cola or beer/wine. If you put more value on this type of water than other beverages, it's still affordable, I think.\n",

      "When roasting coffee, there is always a decision on how far to go.  Too little does not develop the nuanced coffee flavor but gives a solid drink, too much yields acrid, bitter blechh so common in certain national chains.  Melitta has addressed this dilemma by including both horns, a well-roasted Noir, and substantial body from the so-called Blanc (medium roast).  What you get is a very drinkable blend without the harsh overtones which have been modulated by the lighter roast.  Of course, being a pre-ground blend, it is important to store properly after opening to maintain this flavor balance.\n",

      "I really wanted to like this product.  I hadn't heard of the brand, so visited the company's website.  I was pleased that the company stated it did not use any ingredients from China, especially in light of the well-publicized problems in that country's food supply.  (I was not, however, pleased to see that the product arrived in a box labeled \"Made in Thailand\".  I would not have willing chosen the food from the store if I had seen that label.)<br /><br />My cats don't eat wet food too often...I tend to think of it as kitty junk food.  But they are always pleased when I serve it, meowing loudly until I get the food onto a plate and down to the floor.<br /><br />On the first day, we tried the Chinese Chicken.  When I opened it, I actually thought it smelled fairly good.  (Not that I was going to taste it, but it did not smell like yucky cat food.)  The chicken was clearly identifiable as white meat chicken with bits of carrot.  The cats' first reaction was to sniff the food cautiously (I assume they were confused by the scent).  The younger cat ate a few bites and walked away.  The older cat (who is fatter and usually licks the plate clean) ate a few more bites, then he was done.<br /><br />On day two, we tried the Chicken Pot Pie.  As I was opening the can, I noticed that it sounded very watery, and upon opening the can, this was confirmed.  The food had chunks of chicken, carrots, and some type of small white bits.  The cats did not like this food as much as the Chinese Chicken.  They licked up the sauce and left.<br /><br />Except for its country of origin, I was pleased with the quality of the food.  The chicken looked like chicken, the carrots like carrots, etc.  At less than a dollar a can, it is comparable to other retail brands.  Unfortunately, my cats don't eat it, so I don't plan on buying it again.  I rated it 4 stars for the company's effort...they can't please every cat's taste buds!\n",

This is a completely different cereal now, and one that I wouldn't buy. It's definitely not worth the price anymore. Not only is it less \"healthy\" (the reason most of us bought it in the first place!), the texture and appearance is like a 99 cent generic bag of corn flakes. Except those taste better than this does.<br /><br />The product I received is NOT what I paid for; after weeks of trying to like it, I'm ready to request a refund. Yes, it's that bad now. If you used to like this cereal, don't buy a 4 pack until you've tried it.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed. It WAS the only high-protein, somewhat lower carb cereal that didn't taste (or cost) like diet food. I'd eat a bowl and not feel hungry before lunch. It was slightly sweet, even my kids liked it! Guess what? They don't like the new version, either...kind of a big deal considering Kellogg TRIPLED the sugar!<br /><br />Definitely putting my Subscribe & Save on hold.

She is in college and this coffee has become her study buddy. I would say it has a good flavor to it, but if you like a stronger coffee than this is not for you. If you like coffee as long as it does not taste like coffee, then I highly recommend this one. I do like it. It just does not have that coffee taste and does not really get me going.

Still treats are treats, and as such, the ingredients in these once/per day treats are acceptable to me.<br /><br />The amazon.com price for the large biscuits is $3 per pound --- way cheaper than some of the other things marketed as teeth-cleansing, but still, $3 per pound - even with free shipping - is a little high. I checked and these are not offered as subscription items, which would knock off 15% of the price.<br /><br />Overall summary: I give this product 4 stars, marking down just slightly for price & ingredients.

      "I purchased this raw honey, in hopes that it will do wonders for my health and my blemished skin, but my hopes were set up too high.<br /><br />The raw honey does have a unique taste at first but after half way through the bottle, the taste gets annoying. It's not as tasteful as the honey that is sold on grocery stores. This one is more thick and therefore makes it VERY hard to spread around your waffles or pancakes.<br /><br />I read many reviews stating that this honey is good for your health. Well ever since taking it, nothing really changed at all. I've had this honey for months and no significant health improvement of any kind has happen.<br /><br />I was mostly aiming at the skin issues that I have. I heard honey is recommended as a mask to kill bacteria on the skin that could cause blemishes. So with all of the health benefits that this honey was said to have, I trusted that it would not only improve my health but also help fight my acne. Well it sure didn't do a single thing to change my skin condition. Just hours of annoying thick honey on my face. No blemish was stopped, no quickness in fading away the red spots and absolutely no skin improvement of any kind. My skin didn't feel cleaner at all nor did it glow or changed a single thing. A simple soap sure left me more satisfy than putting this on my face day after day in hopes that it would help.<br /><br />Bottom line is that this is a good product if you are just using it as a substitute for sugar. It has that sweet taste for the sweet tooth. It's thick but if you have time you could warm it up in the microwave or in something hot.<br />THIS IS NOT A HEALTH REMEDY OR ACNE FIGHTING TOOL!!!<br /><br />So if your planning on getting this to help fight acne, I would recommend spending that money for a product that at least labels it self with the ingredients to fight acne. This is just for the sweet tooth!\n",

It is exceptionally flavorful, and really able to hold the strong flavor.  The aroma is incredible.

Nor is it particularly spicy -- I can't handle spicy foods and I don't have a problem with this.  This tea is a little heartier than most -- I have taken to drinking it instead of coffee in the morning.<br /><br />I haven't been quite as impressed with the other Stash teas I've tried (they're okay, but nothing special) and generally prefer Mighty Leaf or Tazo -- but this tea quickly jumped to the top of my favorites list -- I'll be ordering much more.\n",

I have always loved this chocolate to the extent my husband buys it for me whenever he sees it and I also buy my own. Used to be, the smooth chocolate coupled with crunchiness of the hazelnut were delectable! However, it seems to me as evidenced by its taste now that the maker of this chocolate has compromised its taste. I thought I just got a bad or old batch when I first noticed the taste about 7-8 months ago but I didn't. I still did not believe that the taste has changed, I bought this chocolate many times after and in fact, has about 8 pieces left from the 36/pcs/pk I got from Sam's Club. The taste has definitely changed in a way that first; the chocolate tastes more like sugar instead of tasting the chocolateness of it and second; the hazelnuts are smaller and seems to not be as fresh as it used to be. I am very sad that if ever the manufacturers of this chocolate was trying to cut cost, it has altered the quality taste of this chocolate, then it won't be worth buying it anymore. After the batch that I have with me, I don't think I will buy anymore out of my own pocket unless somebody gives it to me. I hope they will bring it back to its original taste as I am an avid fan of this chocolate for over 20 years now.\n",

      "My sister and I were out to lunch.  I drink ONLY unsweet tea, and she used to drink ONLY sweet tea. I ordered my unsweet and she ordered WATER.  I was shocked, but kept my mouth shut.  When the water was delivered, she popped open her little MIO sweet tea and squirted a bit in her water.  Then she told me to taste it!! That was it!! I was hooked!!<br /><br />This makes water wonderful! And no calories, and no caffeine, I can drink it all day and night!!<br /><br />I got some that day, and carry it in my purse, I have one at work, and at home by my coffee pot.  This stuff is great!!\n",

      "As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for \"alive and aware raw cacao\" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say \"out of stock\" or \"currently unavailable\" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the \"brands\" and \"vendors\" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said \"alive and aware\" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food \"of the Gods\" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!\n",

About 1/3 the calorie requirement of a medium-sized woman per day.  Much more than a caramel mocha with whipped cream at McDonalds.  So, if I want to eat them it will be few and far between.

The crystals desolve readily and provide a wonderful mellow sweetening that does not overpower the rather more delicate coffee flavours I am fond of - excellent with Hawaiian coffees like Kona.<br /><br />Some forms of rock sugar - even significantly more pricey versions - can be hard to desolve and require significant amounts to achieve the desired level of sweetness, also sometimes imparting other strong flavours.

They could not figure out how to get out the little treats inside, because there are flaps covering the opening, which you bend to pop in the little treats.  These flaps keep the little treats from falling out when the ball moves, but they were just thick enough so that my dogs couldn't figure out how to push them aside to get at the treats.<br /><br />In all fairness, my dogs are chihuahuas--the biggest is about 7 pounds -- and a larger dog may very well have more fun with this.

      "------------------\n",
      "I was extremely pleased with the Coffee from [...], all the flavors were great. Good quality beans, each with unique tastes and aromas. The two mugs really were a nice bonus as well. I usually brew 6 cups every morning for me and my roomate and I still have about 7 sample packs left since November (3 Months). Really my only complaint is that there was no \"Plain Coffee\" variety in the sampler. Raspberry, Chocolate, Creme Brulee, etc, are nice, and the sampler came with just enough of each flavor that it didn't get bothersome, but for a long period of time I'm really looking for just a traditional brew as opposed to novelty flavors. All in all I will definitely be purchasing my beans from [...], from now on, because they roast directly before packaging and deliver next day. I am in New Jersey though, about an hour from their HQ, shipping time is probably longer to areas further away.\n",

      "Love, love, love this cereal.  It's the best-tasting granola I've ever eaten.  The pumpkin seeds are a brilliant<br />addition.  As others noted, it's a bit high in calories compared to other healthy and natural cereals but most granola is that way. For a treat for breakfast every now and then it's worth it. Or you can eat it for dinner. It's that good! I put soy milk in it sometimes for a different flavor. You don't need to eat a whole cup of it to satisfy you.  And you can sprinkle it on plain yogurt and fruit for added crunch.  I found I needed to keep it wrapped up tight or it gets \"soggy\" as do most cereals. Happy crunching!\n",

If you have tried other brands of coconut water and really didn't get the craze, it's worth giving this product a try. I can hardly keep the stuff around. I receive a case a month but am finding I just drink it way faster and have to order additional cases.<br /><br />Things to keep in mind:<br /><br />-This coconut water has no added sugar, but has more naturally occurring sugar than some other brands (different coconut varieties from around the world produce coconuts that vary in nutritional facts)<br />-This particular product has pulp (pieces of coconut) inside. If you don't want the pulp, Taste Nirvana has a coconut water that doesn't have pulp<br />-Although this is a healthy way to rehydrate, it is much more expensive than water and can become addicting.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "(I thought I had reviewed this product already, but perhaps it was under a different size? Oh, well)<br /><br />With apologies for possible redundancy, I will simply say that this stuff is fantastic.<br /><br />Other reviewers have written about the \"clean\" taste, and I can say that after tasting this product, I wholeheartedly agree. It just tastes fresh.<br /><br />And it melts in your hand. And tastes terrific in food.<br /><br />It DOES have a delicious fresh scent, but make no mistake, it does NOT smell like suntan oil. If you wear it on your skin, you will not smell like the stuff that comes in a brown bottle. It actually fades relatively quickly, but no one will accuse you of rolling around in coconuts.<br /><br />Same goes for putting in food. I think it adds a nice depth and nuttiness, and is yummy in popcorn, as some have stated. But it is absolute HEAVEN in your fried brekkie potatoes.<br /><br />Think it is also worth mentioning that to the lower ratings reviewers, I think that ordering this product in the cooler months has merit. If it becomes liquid at 75-ish degrees, I can see that it would be easy for this stuff to leak, despite what appears to be the best efforts on the part of the manufacturer when it comes to the packaging.<br /><br />Finally, I think that the 15 oz size is fine if you are going to be using this product for topical use only, but if you plan on cooking with it as well, I would recommend getting a larger size-<br /><br />Can't wait to use this during the summer, and show off my glowing skin!<br /><br />Hope this helps!\n",

Unfortunately, that was not apparent at the time of my selection, and I just thought they were tea bag type coffee-bags. I have also learned that my taste in coffee is WILDLY different than most others, or at least it would seem. I have since tried to brew it in my Keurig (anothers recommendation that I read on a message string) and found it came out pretty good still. I still give it 4 stars, and I still think it wasn't bad at all, in spite of using it the wrong ways. :-)<br /><br />This is so strong that I could almost make an entire pot of coffee with one bag. I love it. A little goes a long way for me. I also like the tea bag type of brewing. Keeps everything clean and good tasting. This is great for those lazy days when you just want to boil water and have a coffee. If you like your coffee really strong, put one in a mug and you will have one VERY strong cup of coffee. If not, make a small pot and you will also be very pleased. I really didn't know what to expect. I remember trying something similar a long time ago with an instant type of coffee and it was terrible. This is much better than I expected. I also think this offers a good value.

      "If you like peanuts, you'll love this bar as it's basically all peanuts (peanuts with a little granola in the bar, along with peanut butter on the bottom of the bar). I'm not sure why they call this a granola bar - it does contain granola but the peanuts hide any taste (or texture) of the granola. Taste-wise, it is good although if you're not use to sweets, this bar would probably seem too sweet to you. I wouldn't recommend keeping one of these anywhere where it could get hot and melt - I would think that the peanut butter bottom could cause a mess on a hot day.<br /><br />I also tasted the Triple Nut bar by Planters and of the 2 bars, I like the Triple Nut bar better - while I do like peanuts, I liked the addition of almonds and cashews better than this bar.<br /><br />All that's missing is a chocolate coating and this could be called a candy bar. Considering the nutritional value of these bars, eat one as often as you would a candy bar. This is not a healthy treat, but it is tasty.\n",

This tastes delicious and it was so easy.<br /><br />You get 6 individually packaged boxes and each package has the directions. The packages contain one foil packet of the paste.  I first melted the butter with the water and then mixed the paste in. Then I added the chicken and cooked until ready.  That's it!  It was really all I did and it came out great.  The smell in the house while this is cooking was heavenly.<br /><br />I used a little less butter than the recipe asked for and it still turned out delicious.  We served this over rice and we really enjoyed it.<br /><br />There is also a Microwave Oven recipe for those folks that don't have a stove or would rather use the Microwave.<br /><br />The expiration dates on these were all well out into late next year, so I have plenty of time to use these.  But, there is no way they are going to last that long.  I'm sure I'll use these all up in the next month or so.<br /><br />Because of the great success with this item, I ordered some of the other items from this line.

My Mother was delighted about the organic aspect, but I don't care one way or the other personally. I want a snack that tastes good and feels satisfying and the Love Crunch does that very nicely. The only complaint I have is when compared to average grocery store granola snacks, thie Love Crunch is VERY expensive.

      "Ancient Harvest quinoa linguine is a good gluten-free substitute for gluten-based linguine. This corn-quinoa blend looks like gluten-based linguine when cooked, and while not the same as gluten-based, the texture is much better than most rice-based pastas - it doesn't have an al dente bite, but it does twirl up on a fork, if not overcooked.  The flavor is not typical of linguine, but it's also not off-flavored - it's neutral-flavored and pairs well with red sauces, and is also acceptable with delicate or mild sauces.  To prevent the pasta from sticking or clumping, follow the directions, and in addition, stir the water while adding the pasta, so that it doesn't have the chance to stick together.  For those on gluten-free diets, this quinoa linguine is the closest I've tasted to gluten-based and can be served to the whole family without complaint.<br />Ancient Harvest quinoa linguine is organic, made in the USA, and manufactured in a gluten-free facility.<br />Each serving has 205 calories, 46 g carbs, 4 g protein, 1 g fat, 4 mg sodium, 0 mg cholesterol.<br />Ingredients: organic corn flour, organic quinoa flour.\n",

      "As with a lot of older people, my 85 year old mother tends to skip breakfast and since she takes several medications, I thought she should have something to eat with the meds. She lives in MO, I live in TX so I can't run over to take her breakfast.  I have ordered Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies and had them sent to her a couple of times.  She has enjoyed all of them.  I have to eat gluten free so I have not personally tasted them but she says all of the flavors I have sent were very good.  They make a great \"gift\" for her - once you are that age, there is very little that you need as a gift for an occasion, birthday, Mother's Day, Christmas, etc. - I have found that giving her something edible makes way more sense than giving her something that will just clutter up her house.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "The first thing to know about these candies is that they are not gummies in the typical sense.  I'd classify them more as jellies.  They are much softer than gummi bears, so soft that they would all be merged together into one blob by the time you bought them, _except_ that they have a stiffer \"shell\" on the outside to help them keep their shapes and remain separate.  That part works fine, and even in warmer temperatures they hold up well and don't get sticky.<br /><br />The combination of the stiffer outer shell and soft center (similar center consistency to sunkist fruit gems) make the overall texture kind of interesting, and I think it might grow on me over time, but I still prefer the good old Gold Bears I grew up on.  For a change, these would be good on occasion though.  They also don't stick to your teeth like Jujyfruits do, so that's another plus.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty good, and a little more interesting than typical gummi flavors, but it seems like there's something missing in the flavor mix, perhaps another tart flavor in there would better round things out, or a more intense flavor of some kind.<br /><br />Of the four family members that tried them, one hated them, two loved them, and I'm still kind of on the fence, so I'd rate them 3-3.5 stars overall.  Good, but not exceptional unless you have a particular liking for the texture and flavors, or if you remember them from childhood or a memorable trip overseas, etc.<br /><br />Also note that the packages I received (Aug 2011) actually said \"Made in Spain,\" while the Amazon product description still says Made in Germany as of right now.  Unfortunately, it seems very difficult to purchase any Haribo products in the US that are actually made in Germany anymore.\n",

This one actually tastes good as normal milk powder does if you ever tasted that, I'm glad I stumbled upon it after getting on the internet and researching the formulas. The baby likes it very much as well and the price is great considering the big size of the can. Plus you don't need to run around the stores to find the one and only that sells it.

I bought this on a whim after I had got fed up with wasting money on toys marketed as \"super durable\" and for \"power chewers\" that she would demolish in minutes and would ultimately end up garbage in a day. I figured the treat would keep her busy for while and the rubber felt fairly strong. Boy was I impressed! First though I have to mention that my dog has some unpleasant behavior with certain treat items (rawhides, beef bones, pigs ears) in that she has a drive to bury these things in what ever she can cover it with, which often tends to be bedding or under rugs. SO once I put the treat in the ball she was bound and determined to \"bury\" it in our apartment. The treat got nixed and I gave her just the ball. It has been her favorite toy for years! In fact she once lost it playing in her grandmas muddy yard on a rainy day, looked all over for it and gave up. She was devastated, kept searching for it at home, I was really surprised because she's never gotten attached to a toy like that before. I went out and hunted down a new one for her. Well about a year later while at her grandmas house I let her in from the yard and she's got TWO of these in her mouth the old one and the new one! Leave it to her to find it after all this time. I purchased the first one when she was 2yrs, it spent almost a year outside in Wisconsin's elements and yet it is still in perfect on condition going on 3 years old! Will post photo.

      "As many reviews say, this powder milk tastes like fresh milk. I don't notice any bad smell or aftertaste that always repulsed me when I was a kid and my mom tried to get me to drink powdered milk. As a single person household, it's rare that I can finish off a gallon of milk before it goes bad and I love the idea that I will no longer have to lug up that 8 pound jug of milk up my 31 stairs to my house. I also like the idea of being able to make cheese and yogurt with this powder.<br /><br />Right now, I use this milk for my cereal and my protein drinks. When I want to mix up a protein powder drink, I use 8oz of filtered and chilled water, 1 scoop of protein powder and 2 tablespoons of the powdered milk, cut up a banana into my mixing cup and then use my hand blender and give it a whirl.<br /><br />To reduce on cleanup, I might make 32oz of milk using the hand blender mixing cup add 14 oz water and 1/2 cup of powder milk give it a whirl for 15-30 seconds and put it in a 32oz/quart Rubbermaid leakproof container and then fill up to the 32 oz level and give it a few shakes to finish mixing the quart milk. Then using the my same utensils make my protein drink and one cleanup for two uses.<br /><br />Using a bottle and lots of shaking, I found that it doesn't always fully dissolve the powder until the next day as some have mentioned, but to me, it's not much of an annoyance. If I feel like drinking the milk straight, I might sometimes add a packet of Splenda to 32 oz of the prepared milk and then it tastes better than fresh milk, without adding calories.<br /><br />For my daily use at home to save time, I now make up 10 ready to mix dry protein drinks Baggies at one time. I measure 2 tbls of this dry milk and 1 scoop of my Optimum Nutrition Double Chocolate or Vanilla Ice Cream flavored protein powders. then I simply measure 8 oz of filtered water, coarse chop 1 whole banana and grab a Baggie of my Chocolate or Vanilla pre-measured powder and add it to my hand blender cup and blend it for about 30 seconds to make a delicious, super high protein drink!<br /><br />This product can be awesome for extended backpacking trips of 5-25 days where you can rarely consume enough calories or protein. Most menu plans provide lots of carbs and not so much protein.  For backpacking where you can burn 5,000+ calories a day, I would drink a double load for a quick breakfast drink using a shaker bottle but no fresh bananas of course.<br /><br />Great stuff, save a few bucks by subscribing and after trying it, you can always cancel your subscription if you find this product is not for you.<br /><br />I might try the Saco brand when I run out of the milk, just for comparison, but I cannot imagine that it could taste any better. I have tried other store brand instant non-fat dry milk that was fortified with vitamins A&D bot that gives that reconstituted milk the off flavor and smell.\n",

If you wear this all day, go to sleep and don't have time in the morning to shower, you will stink by that afternoon.  But if you do shower daily (no judgments if you don't), this deoderant is an all-natural wonder.  And I've worn this during hot, humid days in the sun.  And it works!  No rashes or the worries on putting aluminum on your skin.  I am no a lifelong customer!  You should be one too.\n",

I now suspect the praise was \"planted\" by vested interests.<br /><br />The weaknesses of the product are legion. First, it's so hard to get the package open I had to get out the scissors; thinking you could get it open while hiking is delusional. You'll have to stop along the trail and get out a tool. I recommend a hatchet.<br /><br />Finally opened, the first realization is that slugs are less slimy. This in no way resembles a jerky if that's what you were hoping for. It's more like a piece of fruit leather that got left in the bathtub over night. Or just a mashed slug.<br /><br />Then there's the taste.  It basically tastes like sugar. Very unhealthy treat for diabetics certainly; you'll need an electron microscope to read the molecular fine print, but basically it provides a heavy load of cane sugar.<br /><br />At best this is like slimy candy, not jerky at all, not even close. For a vegetarian jerky product that is both tasty and relatively healthy and won't leave your fingers covered in pancake syrup, I recommend Stonewall's Jerqee.\n",

      "Gunpowder tea is green tea, most of which comes from a city named Pingshui in the Eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, south of the Yangtse River Delta, where it has been cultivated for centuries and is known as the \"green pearl\" of tea. Pingshui tea market records date as far back as the Tang Dynasty (AD 618 - 907). The area's gunpowder tea was an important tribute traditionally given to the Chinese emperors; and with the growing trade volume between China and the West it also acquired an increasing number of lovers in Europe. Particularly during the second half of the 19th century, when gunpowder tea export reached its peak, its price on the London market was second only to then-popular Wu Yi Oolong (also from China). Even today, Zhejiang Province still proudly calls itself \"home of silk and tea\" for its two primary natural products.<br /><br />The name \"gunpowder\" derives from the tea's elaborate method of processing, which traditionally lasts several hours and during which the tea leaves are withered, steamed or stir-fried and individually rolled into small pellets. Early foreign traders mistook these pellets for gunpowder or gunshot.<br /><br />Gunpowder tea has a delicate aroma with a slightly smokey note. It should *always* be enjoyed without milk or cream.\n",

If I am making breakfast muffins and want protein in them I will blend a scoop or two of unflavored whey protein powder ( <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MAK59O\">100% Pure Whey Protein Isolate (Natural) Unflavored (Mega Pack) 10 lbs</a> ) with the wet ingredients with no extra water, it works perfectly.

      "I adopted my adorable Edmund last year from a shelter. They sent me home with a small bag of Felidae (NOT grain free version) cat and kitten formula as he was a kitten at the time.<br />I am very concerned about eating healthy WHOLE foods, so I of course want the best for my kitty as well. I did research and found that cats' digestive systems are not designed to eat any grains/fruits/vegetables directly, and basically the only carbs they are to eat are what is already in their prey's stomachs (ie: if a mouse ate something carby and the cat ate the mouse they would get a little of whatever was in it). So I wanted to make sure the ratio of his food was as close to what's found in nature as possible, without breaking the bank.<br />He already seemed to really like the Felidae Grain-included version, so as soon as my starter bag ran out I immediately switched to the grain free variety and he has ONLY eaten this ever since I got him - he LOVES it!<br />I give him one small scoop of this grain free kibble in the morning and then a quarter or so of a large 13oz Felidae grain free can of food (we've tried both the turkey/chicken and the salmon grain free canned ones and Edmund prefers the turkey/chicken but will of course eat anything I give him :-)).<br /><br />He has the absolute SOFTEST, SHINIEST FUR COAT I have ever seen on a cat and he is very healthy and happy. I have to blame at least SOME of this on the fact he only eats grain free Felidae food (the rest is because I love him so ridiculously much!).<br /><br />I LOVE the FREE SHIPPING on Amazon (I buy a case of canned and a bag of dry (or 2 of one) at the same time)! I used to buy this elsewhere, and since it's so heavy shipping would often be almost as much as the product!\n",

I feed my baby almost exclusively homemade foods (besides those my doctor recommends to buy in a jar), so I do use this quite a bit.<br /><br />It is easy to use and it is convenient. My only complaint is the construction. Some of the materials seem a little cheap (for example, the button panel is starting to come off...it is just a sticker). I'm already having to buy another container because the plastic broke on my first one. I called the company to talk to them about it (because it seemed fishy to me that it would break so quickly under normal use, and there is supposedly a warranty) and I got a machine (during normal business hours). No one returned my call. I truly think that any company who makes things for people with babies need to have excellent customer service because their customers are sleep deprived and short on time. This company doesn't even come close to meeting a high standard. I'd rather pay the $25 for the replacement part than deal with the hassle.<br /><br />So, basically, I like the device but I'm not crazy about the quality or customer service (the latter is basically non-existent at this point).<br /><br />All this being said, I researched several other machines before buying this one. I'm not sure I would go back and buy a different device. At least I can buy replacement parts easily!<br /><br />UPDATE: The replacement part didn't fit as it was a newer model than my machine. However, the customer service department did call me back and shipped me an entire new machine (newer model). Unfortunately, it still seems plauged with some problems. The drive shafts sometimes sticks and the buttons don't work very well. Ulimately, for me, not a worry-free machine.\n",

You can find the juice (cut with other juices) in some grocery stores, but finding food concentrate is impossible. To my delight I found this company. The packages were sent frozen and well packed (but starting to thaw so they must be put in the freezer the moment that they are delivered - I would recommend that you buy during the cooler months to help with this).<br /><br />The pricing is pretty high - and I thought twice about it because of that, but when something is hard to find, that usually drives the price up. I have made a couple of things with it and they have been wonderful. I use it sparingly (but you really don't need much to make things since it's real 100% concentrated passion pulp) and it is SOOOO good. I will definitely buy again.<br /><br />Tip - if your budget can swing it, buy 3 lbs of pulp (I got 2 Lillikoi and 1 mango) because the shipping is much more reasonable that way. It appears to keep very well so it's worth buying more when you can.\n",

This is one of my favorite foods ever, and the lingering memory I have of Brazil. Fluffy, moist and made out of Tapioca flour, these little rolls are nothing like American cheese bread-- seriously they aren't! Its hard to describe the taste of one these hot out of the oven, and they're just as fabulous cold.<br /><br />Yoki is the best maker of the dry mix, and you just add eggs and oil and pop them in the oven for an easy, delicious treat or side dish.

      "------------------\n",
      "I am not on a gluten/wheat free diet. Instead, I came across this brand while shopping in my grocery store organic food isle. Since then, I have eschewed all other brands of spaghetti for Mrs. Leeper's Wheat/Gluten Free Organic Spaghetti. Here is why:<br /><br />1) I find it more filling then \"regular\" spaghetti. Typically, pasta leaves me craving more pasta. Not so with Mrs. Leeper's.<br />2) Tastes like the real McCoy.<br />3) Can be frozen after cooking. I boil the entire bag (6 servings) and place what I do not use in individual plastic containers. I defrost as needed.<br /><br />TIP: do not freeze with sauce. If you do, upon defrosting the noodles will break up into tiny little pieces (each less then an inch long). If you freeze the pasta by itself, either defrost it in the fridge, or put in the microwave on the defrost setting. I finish it off by adding the noodles to the sauce in a frying pan. Stir gently and the noodle length will be mostly preserved.<br /><br />4) Easy to cook. The box says boil 8-9 minutes. I find it needs full 12 minutes. At that point it is still slightly al dente.<br /><br />TIP: I do not bother with adding butter/oil. I have never had this pasta stick. Just make sure the water is boiling before you add the pasta. And stir. When I store, even if it seems like the noodles are sticking, once you heat them up, they will come apart. Be gentle, do not force them.<br /><br />One last TIP: initially, I thought the single servings seemed smaller then they are with \"regular\" pasta. However, once you place the serving on your plate with sauce, it is actually adequate. Enjoy!\n",

Now, although they are more expensive than regular chips, they are so much healthier and taste GREAT so I'm not sure I will ever buy regular chips again!<br /><br />However, even though I loved the basic flavors in the 6-flavor variety I wanted to try some of the different varieties because they sounded good.  The only purchase option to try some of these other flavors was to buy a whole box, and I was very skeptical to buy an entire box of 24 if I didn't like the flavor.  This variety pack gave me the perfect opportunity to sample each flavor to determine my favorites!  I wondered what flavors I would be getting since they were not listed in the description, so in case it matters to you:<br />  - Thai Sweet Chili (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Parmesan Garlic (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Jalapeno (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Cheddar (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Sweet Potato (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Sea Salt & Vinegar (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Salt & Pepper (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Chili Limi (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Sour Cream & Onion (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Barbeque (3 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Original (3 .8 ounce bags)<br />I haven't had a chance to sample all of the flavors yet, but the ones I have tried are wonderful.  They taste healthy (although they aren't exactly healthy - they are the better alternative) very crunchy and full of flavor.  The only flavor I don't really care for is the Original, and that's because it is pretty salty.<br />Don't be skeptical - try this variety pack and find your favorite flavor!\n",

Yes, there is a broken cracker here and there, but nothing out of norm. Quite frankly, I think they pack them as they do, in two pouches, two servings each, in order to pump up the volume, so to speak. Each of these boxes contains only four servings (32 crackers). That's not much for the price. This is the only reason for the four, rather then five star rating.<br />2) They are filling and tasty. I am addicted to these crackers with red pepper humus. Yum! They scoop well once you get a hang of it (they are flaky and will break more often then regular crackers would in the same situation).<br />3) The box is made of 100% recycled material, for those to whom this matters.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />PS: There is a warning on the label that says they may contain traces of soy, milk, and sesame, in case anyone is alergic.

So i took her to the vet and everything was normal, the vet gave her some meds just in case it was a stomach bug. The next day my Shepherd starting having the same terrible diarrhea and went in the house.

The real test is in making it. I brewed it this morning--no grounds in my coffee, and no residue left in my cup. Wondered if the soft filter cup at the bottom would work, and it does. How great is that???? It doesn't taste like instant coffee either, which some imitations do. 80 cups for $33 is an awesome deal...that is around $0.42 a cup. If you buy the little boxes at WalMart you only get 18 for $10..which is around $0.61 per cup...you save $0.19 per cup, which doesn't sound like a lot, but you would spend $50 buying as much at WalMart to get 80 K cups.

      "I bought these to try to supplement my fiber intake without having to deal with powders and pills. Over the last few years I've found that increasing my fiber intake is a great way of losing weight and maintaining it, so I try to get around 30g a day. Foods high in fiber fill you up more quickly and aid in digestion, The Daily Recommended Value of fiber for adults is 25g per day. Most people in America probably get much less than that, closer to 7-10g a day. At 9g of fiber per serving, just eating one of these bars a day will provide a lot of assistance in meeting the DRV.<br /><br />In addition to the fiber content, the bars really taste great. I've never been a fan of granola-type bars, and figured with a name like \"Fiber One\" these would taste like cardboard, but they are one of the best meal bars I've eaten. They are moist and have a good texture. All of the ingredients seem fresh.<br /><br />At 4g, these bars are very low in saturated fat (they contain poly and monounsaturated fats - the \"good fats). Total net carbohydrates is 19G (28g-9g of fiber), so they do contain a little more sugar than I would like (it is the third largest ingredient). Here is the nutritional info:<br /><br />Calories - 140<br />Total Fat - 4g (2g saturated)<br />Carbohydrates - 29g<br />Fiber - 9g<br />Protein - 2g<br /><br />My only real problem with these bars are the ingredients.  They are fairly heavily processed.  The second main ingredient is \"Semisweet chocolate chips.\"  Following that are whole grain oats, and then corn syrup. Although these are a fairly significant source of additional fiber, I would have preferred they not add all the extra sugar.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "I tried several different flavors of Mentos gum, but was rather disappointed by the overall product.<br /><br />First of all, the good points. The gum comes in a hard, durable container, which is easy to carry around in one's pants pocket, and also facilitates dispensing. Additionally, I like the initial texture of the gum, as it has a hard exterior shell and a soft chewy interior core, which immediately releases a burst of flavoring. Lastly, the texture and consistency of the gum is maintained throughout the mastication process.<br /><br />Now, the bad part. The biggest drawback is that the flavor only lasts at most a few minutes, necessitating me to eat several pieces at once in order to maintain any semblance of lasting mint flavor. Compared to other rival brands such as Dentyne or Eclipse, this is unacceptable. I'm not interested in chewing a piece of bland plastic after just 2-3 minutes. Some have also commented that the hard container makes too much noise in one's pants pockets when walking around.<br /><br />In summary, the Mentos are best used as an ephemeral breath mint, rather than a long-lasting gum.<br /><br />Now in regards to this particular flavor of red fruit lime, I find that the flavor lasts slightly longer as compared to the mint flavor.  Still not long enough, but just a smidgeon longer.  Additionally, the packaging is deceptive, because the core of the gum is most certainly not green colored.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "This review is provided in the context of Splenda use in my coffee and not as a sugar substitue in baking.<br /><br />I have to say I first thought the fiber angle was a gimmick.  While there is no doubt more fiber in your diet is good for you, do we really need it in a sweetner?  Well, I guess I will take it where I can get it, provided it is cost effective and does not alter the taste of my coffee from what I have become accustomed to with original Splenda.  This product does an excellent job in that regard.<br /><br />While we all interpret taste somewhat differently, I found Splenda with fiber to be an excellent substitute to Splenda without fiber in regard to taste.  In fact, I believe it taste better than the original, more akin to raw cane sugar in your coffee, which I like but you may not.  So, in short, I can increase my fiber intake while making my coffee taste better. The \"sweetness ratio\" is about the same- packet for packet.  So, if you are using 3 packets of original Splenda in your coffee, you will more likely than not (depending on individual taste), use the same number of packets with this product.  Currently, the price point is not too far off original Splenda so I find this alternative reasonable.  Not sure how it would work out in baking however.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product.\n",

I ordered the 6-box quantity and received it in a reasonable time.<br /><br />However, of the six boxes I received, five of them had packets that had holes in them or ripped seams.  I discovered this on a business trip when I unzipped my suitcase and found that a few packets had shaken their contents out into my clothes. (There's nothing like having a fine white powder floating around your suitcase when going through Security at the airport.)<br /><br />When I got home, I opened the other 5 boxes and shook each individual packet to make sure no others had holes in them.

This dressing is just pure good, healthy stuff like olive and canola oil and vinegar, and the flavor is wonderful - tangy and smooth. I put it on salads, but also soup, meats, casseroles, breakfast, lunch, dinner. It's good on almost everything to add a burst of flavor. Sometimes I use it on taco dishes as a substitute for cheese and salsa - two foods I cannot have, but without which dishes can be bland. The dressing makes up for it. It does cost a little more than your average dressing, but it's worth it, I think.\n",

      "I have been enjoying coconut water for over 2 years.  For the most part I love the natural \"regular\" variety, but was able to buy a variety pack through Amazon.  After tasting the different flavored varieties, I found that I liked the tangerine but LOVED the peach/mango.  So far, the boxes I have enjoyed have been very consistent in flavor, which is the only downside to coconut water that I have found to date.<br /><br />What I particularly liked about these waters was the container.  It has a small screw top that makes the container resealable and less likely to spoil and/or spill in between drinks.  At 17 ounces it is unlikely for me to finish drinking it in one sitting so I really appreciate this small innovation.  I wish they could do this on the 11 ounce containers but this product is costly enough without adding to the expense.<br /><br />I am giving this particular product 5 stars, because of the combination of great taste and the innovative packaging.  If you need to pay attention to sugar, stick with the unflavored coconut waters because this is sweet, with about twice the natural sugars of the unflavored.  Not a reason to downgrade the product, but something to make a note of if sugar is an issue in your life.<br /><br />Give it a try and enjoy!\n",

      "Scott's Cakes is one of the best brands of fudge I bought all during the past holiday season.  You can't eat any better than this brand.  It's sometimes difficult to find a white chocolate/maple no nut based fudge and I found it.  It's easy to eat the whole container which is nicely wrapped and the truffles are really large approximately 1 and a 1/2 inch yummy fudge.  This is perfect for gift giving with the Scott's paper box it arrived in.  Fudge was fresh and delicious.  ( I know not the nutritional label as it did not arrive with one or I would have posted that information )  The fudge is quite expensive for just 12 pieces but then again these are really large truffles.  5 stars.

      "I bought these chips in May 2009, and they were best eaten by 9/12/2009.  When I first got them, they were very tasty and exactly what I had expected.  I would have rated them 4 or 5 stars then.<br /><br />However starting in early August, there was a definite odd taste that was starting to creep into the chip.  And here in early September they are totally inedible.  My guess is that the oils used have gone rancid in the chip, since they are using natural oils.  Normally this is a very good thing, but the longevity of the product is sacrificed due to it, which is a problem when you are buying chips in 12 bag packages!<br /><br />So if you are purchasing these chips please make sure you are able to eat them quickly, they will not be any good about 1 month before the best eaten by date.  I had to throw away about 5 bags....\n",

      "My days on the university campus are long--they start with office hours at about 7:30 until 10, and then classes until 2 or 3:15.  Office hours later until about five.  I usually carry my own lunch to eat in the office or on the run.  No quiet breaks for me, I usually have students in the office.  When my blood sugar starts dropping, I don't have much time to wait, so a little bar like this serves really well to give me a little boost.  I prefer not to have chips or cookies or crackers, as I need to watch both sugar intake and salt intake.  I'm not gluten-intolerant. That said, I enjoy these little bars by Pamela's Products.  It truly is good for \"Whenever.\"  This particular flavor is soft and very much like a soft-baked oatmeal cookie with chocolate chips and coconut in it--but without the gluten!  The flavor is natural, not very fake-berry flavored or peanut-butter-covering-up-the-flavor-of soy-protein flavored.  It's probably five or six bites for me, and a couple crumbs will fall off as I nosh, but that's okay for me, now that I know.  A bit high in calories (180), but the number of carbs is low (23, before fiber content figures in), so it's a pretty safe treat when you have blood sugar considerations.  It's a darned tasty treat.  I will look for them at my grocer's in the near future, as the long school year gets underway.  Thanks, Pamela!\n",

And even better - more tangy, as well as better for you - when combined with Hibiscus.  I live in Las Vegas, so I drink a couple of large glasses of this awesome red-colored (looks like Sangria) combination as iced tea daily, now that the summer's here, and really love it.

My impressions are that it pulled a nice looking shot with a rich crema and good body. To me the coffee looks and tastes over-roasted. There is no discernable after taste lingering on the palate the way a good espresso does. I am only on day 2 of this bean. I froze most of it in tightly sealed mason jars and vacuum bags. The coffee has no fresh aroma and I am wondering if I received a fresh shipment. If not, their loss. I expected better than this, even considering the low cost. I hope it makes a decent drip coffee. If I change my mind about this bean I will add commentary, but until then I am left wondering about the 4 and 5 star reviewers.\n",

Except for the actual chewy candy texture, they almost taste like eating that sugar-sprinkled morning grapefruit half I used to have for breakfast! Haribo also sells Pink Grapefruit candy like these, but I find the white to be much more 'authentic\" and having that tart taste I like along with the sweet. The ones I have gotten through Amazon are a bit softer than ones I purchased elsewhere; the others were just as flavorful, but a bit tough and I much prefer the ones from here that are just a tad bit softer.

      "------------------\n",
      "I must say how impressed I was with how IGourmet ships its cheese. The cheese is shipped in a styrofoam container with ice packs, to keep the cheese fresh during shipping. The package is Fedexed to ensure freshness. A note in the box mentioned how during summer months, they often pack in dry ice instead of ice packs. Either way, they make a serious effort to ensure your items arrive fresh and ready to eat.<br /><br />The cheese, itself, was not to my taste. This was an expiremental purchase, as I had not tasted Dolce Gorgonzola before. This cheese does not have the same bite as the gorgonzola that most US folks are familar with. The dolce tends to be more tangy rather than sharp. The texture is smooth, almost that of a chevre type cheese, and can be easily spread. It was sampled with fresh french bread, which suited this type of cheese well as its flavor did not compete but rather complimented the cheese. Though I didn't personally like it, that is more because my tastes tend to goat and sharp chedder type cheeses rather than blue family cheeses. If you are a fan of gorgonzola though, then it is definately worth a try.<br /><br />As far as ordering from IGourmet, I was very satisfied. Their selection is broad, packing superb, and their customers include the wine shop that I frequent. That alone is recommendation enough for me, but my experience with their cheeses has always been fascinating. Some tasted good, some not so good, and some were spectacular. And that, is ultimately the beauty of exploring the world of cheese.\n",

Thanks to pill pockets, I have kept him alive and his asthma under control by myself, without adding to his condition due to stress (a common asthma trigger) from forced pilling.  I've heard that some cats don't go for these treats, but my two boys gobble them up, pill and all.  I'm not sure what I would have tried next if these hadn't worked.  If you've had trouble pilling and you've run out of ideas, they are definitely worth a shot.

I use it in my mom's old muffin recipe and I think they come out as good, if not BETTER than when I used to use regular wheat flour.  If you are allergic to nuts, this is not for you since it has almond flour in it, but for recipes that call for nuts (cranberry walnut bread) I find that it actually enhances the flavor.  I have also made brownies, corn bread and chocolate chip cookies with it.  I have served them to non-gluten free people and they had no idea they were \"missing\" anything.

The tea tastes great with and without sugar (my Chinese friends took it without sugar since that's the traditional way there I assume) and even I, who likes tea with some sugar think that it's great without the sugar, in fact, one sugar packet (I used Splenda) overwhelms the flavor of tea. If you want a good green tea with the traditional Chinese flavor, this is for you. The package did not lie in saying that it is \"Unblended China Green Tea\" it was worth every penny.

      "I discovered Tang Energy on a road trip to Charlotte, North Carolina to see Flogging Molly.  Me and my fellow travelers stopped at a convenience store to both use the restroom and ask for directions and stumbled upon a Granita Machine with the Tang logo on it.  What drew us to the beverage was the B vitamins and the Caffeine content.  Little did I know that I was going to be starting what could arguably become an addiction.<br /><br />Every one of us filled a 32 oz cup of this wonderful product and went on our way.<br /><br />Let me just say this, yes, this is the energy drink mix for making frozen slushy drinks, but it is perfectly acceptable as a straight up energy drink.  Unlike people who bought this and made their own own mixtures, I went to the local discount store, bought a 2.5 gallon dispenser to put in the fridge and I mix it two gallons at a time.  You don't need a granita machine and you don't need to drink it frozen.<br /><br />The mix is easy.  1 gallon + 1 pouch = ecstasy.<br /><br />True to the advertisement, each 8oz of Tang Energy Drink mix has 60gm of Caffeine as well as a dose of B Vitamins that really do a great job of packing a megaton of energy content into a great tasting brew of pure heaven.  A single 8oz serving DOUBLES the caffeine content of a can of soda, a cup of coffee and many energy drinks on the market that taste like medicine.  This is tang, but it's better than Tang.  I drink regular tang on a regular basis and this is sweeter, has more of an orange creme-cicle taste to it and it has the added benefit of supercharging your system.  The drink has NONE of the normal medicinal taste that energy drinks have.  They don't have the sweet-followed-by-bitter aftertaste.  I take a gulp of this and there is NO CLUE that what you are drinking is loaded with caffeine or B Vitamins.  I cannot stress this enough...  You have no idea what you are drinking is an 'energy drink' until you've had too much and your heart is racing.<br /><br />The closest I've come to finding a product this good is the fellow Crystal Light Energy line made by Kraft (the same company that makes this masterpiece).  They have they same energy giving caffeine and vitamin content, but lack the sugar and sweeteners.<br /><br />DO NOT buy this unless you intend to make a gallon (it actually ends up being almost 1.25 gallons after mixing) and drink it religiously.  THIS has replaces $3 a pop energy drinks and about 6 cans of soda a day in my life and for that alone it gets 5 stars.\n",

And, I have to admit, I threw out the first pot I brewed of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla because it was too bland.  So when I made the next pot, I added an extra tablespoon of coffee and that made all the difference.  The vanilla scent is very natural and not perfume-y, and the vanilla flavor is nice, but not overpowering.  Add a little milk and sugar and it's a special treat.  I much prefer this to the VIA vanilla packets which, although more convenient, are too strong-flavored and too sweet for me.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you like flavored coffee that is subtle, but well-balanced, this is a good one to purchase.

      "------------------\n",
      "This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.\n",

Granted, she's used to dry cat food but usually she'll scarf down a can of food as a treat. We've tried giving her both kinds of Petite Cuisine that were included (Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie) a few times each, and she'll lap up the liquid but won't touch the chunks of food. It's left to sit and dry out, until we dump it in the trash. She'll even sit next to her bowl and meow angrily at us, looking at the bowl then looking back up at us, until we dump it out and get her some dry stuff! Overall a disappointing experience on this end, but it's worth a try because every cat is different. You may find that it suites your cat's tastes just fine.\n",

I also use coconut oil extensively at home for the taste and health properties (along with olive oil and butter), so the coconut oil in these chips was just an added bonus.<br /><br />I highly recommend these chips.  Honeyville makes freeze dried banana chips as well, if you like that texture better. i just like these, because they remain crispy and tasty (vs. getting mushy faster with freeze-dried products you don't re-vacuum seal)\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "I have always bought and loved the clean \"fresh tuna\" tasting firm meat Polar Tuna when I bought it in my grocers.  But I purchased this product from Amazon in March 2010, and was very disappointed.  Although it looks firm and solid, (and the expiration date is for next November), it smells different, not that \"fresh tuna\" smell it used to have.  It also has that sharp bitter \"bad tuna\" aftertaste that most tuna seems to have for the last 5 or more years.  This bad aftertaste seems to coincide with the various preservatives they have added to tuna.  But on the can, this tuna says it only is \"Albacore, water, salt. Product of Thailand\".  If there is only water salt and tuna, then this tuna is bad. In the old days when I bought Polar tuna in the store, if I put the can in the trash, or left the dish on the counter for a few hours till I filled the dishwasher, it just smelled like fresh tuna smell.  But as soon as the can is opened from this 24 pack, the smell is bad, and it gets worse quickly.  As a last resort to see if something could remove the bad taste, I even tried cooking one can in tomato sauce, and I could still taste the bad tuna taste.<br /><br />I am disappointed, not only because of how it used to be so good, but also on the can it says: All Natural, NO ADDITIVES, NO RESIDUE, NO AFTERTASTE, and that is just not true.<br /><br />I have contacted them by email, and if they get back to me I will update this review.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "I have to disagree with the rave reviews on this cracker. It looks like any saltine, with the minor exception of an orange/red tint, constituting the \"tomato\" content. One might find attractive or novel in comparison to a white saltine. If held close to the nose, a very slight herb scent, the \"basil\" content, can be detected. But it's a scent, not a taste, and that smell is very faint and doesn't seem to last once exposed to air.<br />The taste of tomato/basil in virtually absent.<br /><br />I wanted to like these. I doubt anyone, if blindfolded, could taste the difference between this and any average saltine. I do not think my taste buds are insensitive to subtle flavors. These are just colored saltines, that's it. They are OK, but do not expect flavor as indicated by \"tomato basil\". Nutrition-wise, these are not a \"health food\" by any stretch of the imagination! These have little character, but hey, if you like saltines...<br /><br />Also,there wasn't enough shock absorbent in the packaging to prevent 85% of the crackers from being broken into an average of 3 or 4 small pieces. To survive UPS, maybe they should use a bunch of large bubble wrap or figure out something. My guess is one sharp, flat drop would cause the result I received. The company should ship these to themselves in tests until they can get the packaging right.<br /><br />I recommend  Doctor Kracker Flatbread for texture and quality. I like the \"Organic and Artisan-Baked Klassic 3 Seed\" variety. They were very tasty, didn't arive all broken up, and have a much better protein to calorie ratio.\n",

However, recently I got a new kitten, and decided to try wet food on him. So I bought a couple cans of the Aristocats brand, on sale for 39 cents each. At first, the kitten had no interest in it - but ironically, the older cat did! He loves the stuff and begs for it as a treat in the mornings and evenings. The kitten saw his \"big brother\" enjoying the Aristocats so much, he started eating it, too. So now both of my \"boys\" are getting some wet food in their diet, and loving it. I bought the 24-can pack, once their enjoyment of the Aristocats brand was established, and am now well set for a while with wet food for them.

      "------------------\n",
      "I have had many different kinds of grits and these are superior to all.  They are \"slow-cooking\" grits, which are the best in my opinion.  The texture is amazing and it is hard to eat any other brand after having these.  Now, since they are slow-cooking grits, the directions say they take 1 hour to cook.  That is easily remedied by simply pre-soaking the grits the night before you cook them.  After 8 hours of soaking overnight, they take a mere 15-20 minutes to cook.  Not to mention if you need them to be ready for dinner, the grits \"pre-soaking time\" can be dramatically reduced to 3-4 hours if you soak them in HOT water.<br /><br />All that being said, I noticed for several different kinds of grits sold on Amazon that many reviewers claim those grits to be the best they had.  It begs the question, what is so distinctive about Carolina Plantation grits?  Simple put: the texture.  Unlike most grits (especially quick cooking grits), Carolina Plantation grits have a nutty texture to them.  It is the difference between regular oatmeal vs steel cut oats.  These grits are robust and you can taste all the tiny \"kernals\" as you eat a mouthful.<br /><br />Thus if you prefer the more \"porridge\" texture for grits, then do not get these.  However, if you like a more nutty texture, Carolina Plantation grits are unsurpassed!<br /><br />UPDATE:  As of 2-23-11, the grits are \"currently unavailable\".  Just type in \"CAROLINA PLANTATION\" in Google and their website pulls up easily.  The prices on their website is still reasonable.  Enjoy!\n",

I have a new microwave, but perhaps its wattage is not high enough. I heated some lard in my fryer and tossed the under-cooked ones into the hot fat.  They puffed some more, and some of them were edible.  Then, I put a few of the uncooked chips in the fryer, and finally I had the pork skins I was hoping for! Hot, puffed, crispy, delicious.

We quickly did some web searches & found out that the newer formula is supposed to dissolve rather easily with water.  After making sure she drank a good amount of water, we monitored her activity.  In the end, she had no problems & we were able to find a treat that is more chewable than your biscuit type treats, but safer than rawhide (at least for her).

Thankfully that is not the case here.<br />* It mixes very well, and tastes great.<br />* Good price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Only one: it has 200% RDA of vitamin C per serving. Since about 2g of vitamin C in a day is the safe upper limit, that puts a limit on how much you can drink in very long activities.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />* Contains glutamine and BCAAs (2mg per serving).

This may not be an issue for most die-hard coffee drinkers, but for me, much of this bag will probably go to waste.<br /><br />Generally speaking, this Starbucks bagged coffee tasted like that flavor of beans at the local Starbucks that no one likes, so it's been sitting there for weeks.

Unless you have a very small dog, your dog's attempts will just move the toy around on the floor.  For larger dogs (like ours) the toy is way too lightweight and the flaps over the cups are too low to the ground for effective \"nosing the flap\" technique. In addition, any dog who couldn't nose the flap effectively would need to use her mouth -- and would naturally pick the arm up in her mouth in an attempt to get at the treats in the cup - thereby dumping all of the treats out of the other cups (hey - problem solved!!!). So, that means to play with this, you'd have to be there to hold the toy down/in-place while your dog does the puzzle and gets the treats.<br /><br />I think this toy would work best (maybe) for a small dog. Kyjen needs to make a heavier and larger sized version for medium or larger dogs.<br /><br />---------<br />.... Now, the details ....<br /><br />First, let me give you some sizing basics about this toy, so you can see if it will be a match for your dog's size.  I measured the toy and it's 10\" wide.  The top of the drop-in treat hole chamber is 4\" high. Each arm sticks out almost 4\" from the middle dispenser. Each treat cup at the end of the arm is about 2\"x2\" when you lift the flap.  If you look at the very end of the arm, where the flap shuts, the height of the flap edge from the ground is under 1\".  The arms of the toy obviously slope upwards from the end, so I am talking about the very end of the arm. This is an extremely lightweight plastic toy, weighing in at just 6.2 oz.<br /><br />Whew, now that all the stats are out of the way... how is the actual puzzle toy?<br /><br />Initially, I had all the flaps open and just put a treat in an open cup so they could \"find\" it. They didn't have to open the flaps during that phase. The 2x2\" cup size is just adequate enough for them to get the treat out. If your dog is good at licking a treat out, this small size will work fine. If your dogs likes to mouth the treat out, and you have a larger dog, the 2x2 chamber size will likely be an issue. Our GSD was having trouble getting treats out because of this, although she eventually figured out how to cram her nose in there and use her tongue at the same time. :)  I would imagine a really large dog would have to be pretty good with his tongue to get a treat out of the small cups.<br /><br />An issue that appeared right away even with this simple usage was that the toy is SO lightweight it moves as soon as the dog touches it. I had to hold the toy in place or else they would just push it across the floor while trying to lick the treat out of the (flap open) cup.  I think Kyjen needs to add some weight to help keep this toy from moving so easily. The bottom has little rubber non-skid feet on each arm, but they do nothing.<br /><br />So... moving on to the phase where they had to open the flap to get the treat.... There is an issue here. For larger dogs, the flap is so low to the ground, that they can have trouble nosing it up. Our Golden tends to lie in front of what she \"finds\" when scenting. So, her head was already down on the ground level, which made it easier to work on flipping open the very-low-to-the-ground flap. Our GSD stays standing, though. So, from that angle, she couldn't really use her nose to flip the flap up (although she tried). She also used her mouth to try and open it, pawed at it, etc. I'm sure if I wasn't there to hold the toy from sliding, she would have just picked the whole thing up in her mouth -- problem solved! :)<br /><br />Now you can see why I wrote my summary above. From my experience, this is just the wrong size/weight toy for our dogs. I'll still use it for scent games, because I only need to drop one piece at a time in and I can hold the toy in place for this. But I am not sure how else this toy could be used unless you have a small dog.<br /><br />This is a hard toy to rate because of these issues. It's a good idea, but the implementation is flawed. Which is why I rated it so low.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />c-\n",

It was just overall a disappointing experience. We had bought two boxes, and I took the very unusual (for me) step of returning the unopened one to the grocery store.

      "BEST Organic Dog Food Ever!\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "If you're on the fence about whether to try this food out for your dog or not, please do both of you a favor and get this food!  This is by far, the BEST dog food I have come across and I have been telling everyone who cares about their dog(s) to get this food for their own dogs.<br /><br />For years, my dog had been having issues with dog food in general, and was diagnosed as having a 'sensitive stomach' which is when I began my quest into dog food research.  Added to this was the dog food recall scare from a couple years ago and I started looking into healthier alternatives for dog food.  First and foremost, I found that about 90 percent of dog food that had been drilled into our heads as being 'good' and 'healthy' for my dog was in fact the exact opposite. Bad food filled with bad things and bad by-products and fillers.  In other words, I had been feeding my poor dog 'junk food' for years and I felt horrible once I discovered the truth about dog food.<br /><br />My dog had been having issues with soft stools, etc. and was not doing well. After several expensive visits to the vet to rule out any serious medical conditions (which they were not going to rule out unless I spent more $$ on more tests to determine this), I decided to start with the food.  I did a ton of research online and came upon this food and decided to give it a try.  I was looking specifically for Organic, Healthy Food made 100 percent in the USA so I would not have to worry about miscellaneous ingredients making their way into my dogs' food (like with the big brand names), which is when I came across Organix Dog Food. Not only did they fit all of my requirements, they went a step further with the Fiber Content in their food.  I learned that most other dog foods had a fiber content of between 1-3 percent making them very low in fiber.  Then I discovered that to be healthy for dogs, they needed a fiber content of 5 percent or higher, which I found out this food had!  Score!<br /><br />I bought this food with all of this in mind and my dog and I have not been disappointed. My dog now loves to eat his Organix dog food, he now has NORMAL stools and he no longer has to go in to the vet for more expensive medical tests.  I can honestly say, this food has been the BEST for him and I am very grateful to have found it.  If your dogs are having similar problems, please give this food a try and I bet you too will be pleasantly surprised.  Thing is, when you switch ANY dogs' food, you have to do so gradually, over about a week or so with their old dog food and the new food until you fully switch them over to the new food.  That said, expect good results at the end of that transition, once they are 100 percent transferred onto this new food.<br /><br />The main reason I wanted to leave this review on here was to help other dog owners out there who are looking for healthier alternatives to their dogs' current food, so their dogs can live healthier, happier lives as well.  Best of luck to you and your dog(s)!\n",

I recently got a bag of the Starbucks version that is mixed with sugar and it blends very easily with hot water. They don't sell it in their stores in powder form like you can buy coffee, but I know enough people in the Starbucks biz to get it on a regular basis. I think I will stick with that version for a hot tea, but I think this 1lb bag is good value for my baking purposes. Hopefully the ice cream will be as good as I want it to be!\n",

On to taste... well the one I was hoping would be really great - the spicy one wasn't spicy - well not to my taste anyway.

On to the Cowgirl flavor - this one was a bit better for me as far as flavor and aftertaste.  The original flavor was quite good also as was the fourth flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line... even though this one was the best textured jerky I can't say that the flavors bowled me over.

Seriously, the litter itself smells great, and then it seems to totally neutralize the odors right away.  We might smell it as soon as she does it, but the smell is gone in no time.  We changed the litter out yesterday because I had only put a small amount in the box and I wanted to start fresh before I put the right amount in.  It didn't \"need\" to be changed yet...<br /><br />We'll see how it goes, but I think this is a winner... :-)\n",

Solid at room temperature, smooth and buttery and melts at 76 degrees; cook/fry with it on low heat for a healthy and fragrant alternative to all those ulgy refined oils and hydrogenated trans fats (YUCK!), use as a lighter butter or shortening alternative (there's not a lot of flavor and the smell is intoxicating); use as hand cream (rub it on - only gets greasy if you really over load the area) I use it as a body lotion all over my body (my skin feels soft and smooth like it did when I was a child), hair conditioner (a light deep conditioner); anti-fungal properties (put it between your toes for goodness sake!) make-up remover - voila!  ear wax?

Very impressed.<br /><br />Suggestions to Planters:<br />I actually called planter's 1877 # to make some of these suggestions:<br />-The label says \"quality USA .. TM (trade mark)\", and that got me thinking, is this made in the USA or not?  According to the SKU # that I provided, planters customer rep said that these peanuts were roasted in the USA.  I suggested that they write that.<br /><br />-I can't imagine anyone would want the regular salted peanuts!  Planters should have \"lightly salted\" be the default.  People would probably eat Less of the regular planters peanuts and it's less healthy.  Even for this lightly salted version, there's a disclaimer that reads \"Contains 95mg sodium per serving compared to 190 in planters dry roasted peantus, not a low sodium food.\"  Well, why not have 3 grades, no salt, almost no salt, and finally lightly salted and get rid of the regularly salted.<br /><br />The label does say \"Kraft Foods Global, INC.  Northfield, IL, USA.\"  I really want to know if these peanuts were grown and roasted in the USA.  It helps to write which part is in the USA at the minimum.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />Taste like peanuts, no complaints, just wish it's even less salty.

      "One of the biggest challenge to mix more than one fruit flavor in tea is to be able to balance the taste and aroma of the two fruits, so the tea doesn't taste and smell like one or the other. I love real mango and coconut, so when I saw this tea displayed in the grocery store, I couldn't wait to try it. I must say I was a little disappointed because after brewing a cup, I immediately noticed only the aroma of the coconut, and the taste of the tea proved it that way as well. Though there are other brands that utilize Mango and do a better job in their flavored tea, I am still happy that I got to know this Stash tea as there aren't that many brands that use the coconut flavor in their tea.\n",

I use the small on my 8lb dog and the medium on my 14 lb terrier and 17 lb mini aussie.

I like the size they are, a size any dog could eat although bigger dogs will probably need at least a few pieces per treat (there is a serving recommendation versus dog size printed on the bag). They are a perfect size for our Shih Tzu. At 4 ounces per bag they are a pretty good value for a quality dog treat. For our Shih Tzu who weighs about 20lbs (big) one bag can last a couple of weeks easily if we ration them out.<br /><br />Overall, I was also impressed with the ingredient list and no artificial colors or additives and real beef. As others pointed out dogs probably would have liked them just as much without the corn syrup though. I will be buying these again as our canine loves them, the size lets you ration them however you would like (just a little or a lot per serving), and they are a good value.\n",

I simply adore their Tahitian Vanilla Hazelnut, and figured that anything else with vanilla in it would be as good.<br /><br />I drank three cups of this tea, steeped at 4, 6, and 8 minutes. I found it had practically no flavor steeped at four minutes, and had a bitter taste, somewhat dirty tasting, at eight. Unfortunately, even at six minutes, I found the tea to be too weak for my liking. The vanilla flavor was almost undetectable to me. I added a bit of cream, for this often will bring out the flavor of weak tea, but I just did not find this tea tasty. Whether it gave me a \"lift\", I can not say, for I don't respond to coffee either.<br /><br />Yogi's Vanilla Hazelnut tea has a strong vanilla taste, and I was probably expecting something like that, but it is an herbal tea and can be steeped for a long time without becoming bitter. I figured I was merely disappointed, as I love Yogi's herbal teas so much. In the interest of being fair (and also because I had almost two full boxes), I gave one box of the Perfect Energy to a friend who drinks tea and had not sampled any of the Yogi brand.<br /><br />Here's the email I got two days later:  \"I like it because it was smooth, flavorful, not too sweet and gave me the energy it promised! I would really love that other box!\" Obviously, she really liked it a lot!<br /><br />Tea is a matter of taste, especially teas that are blends, such as this one. If you're looking for a lot of vanilla flavor and no caffeine, I'd recommend their Vanilla Hazelnut. If you like a more subtle taste, and do want caffeine, you might want to give this a try.\n",

It has a very light, fresh taste and produces a transparent greenish colored brew.\" I agree, but please note that the tea is distinctively flavored, not mild (which I really like) and delivers a wonderful tea experience.<br /><br />I highly recommend it, and if you enjoy Asian teas, or want a true green tea, you'll not go wrong here.<br />*****\n",

      "...these muffins are a big disappointment.  See that lovely BROWNED muffin top on box picture?  Welllll, I've tried several boxes of these, using different oven temperatures, making them plain, with fruit, with nuts, with everything I could think of except chocolate (hmmm, maybe I'll try that!)  The tops stay a pale, pasty WHITE!  Sooo unappetizing.  And false advertising, IMHO.<br /><br />Now for the taste.  Another disappointment.  They are bland bland bland, blah, blah, blah!  You MUST add additional ingredients or they are just plain, uh, RICEY tasting - and if you're an older celiac, you know what I mean.  Those first corporate attempts at making GF mixes were hideous!  These are no better.  Yuck!<br /><br />Now for the size.  I'm a pretty doggone accomplished baker if I do say so myself, both prior to my diagnosis in 1985 with non-GF ingredients, and since, using mixes and baking from scratch.  These just don't RISE!  See the photo with that lovely dome muffin shape?  Nuh-uh.  Perhaps they use old, REALLY old leavening?  Dunno.  But they puff up only about 1/16\" of a centimeter.  Maybe.  But I doubt it.<br /><br />Now for the boxed ingredients.  Cheesh, you have to add all of the EXPENSIVE stuff to make these work.  Butter, milk, eggs, and fruit/nuts/whatever.  Fer cryin' out loud, it's truly no more trouble, and a WHOLE lot cheaper to make muffins from scratch.<br /><br />I desperately wanted to love these and give a great review.  But I just cannot.  Make your own muffins and save your hard-earned money for some of the Gluten-free Pantry's other mixes - I rate the following 5 stars without hesitation:<br /><br />Country French Bread mix - absolutely delicious!!  We use our bread machine and they come out PERFECT every time!  And when we've used regular oven, in our french bread loaf pans, we add some toasted sesame seeds, and they are incredible.<br /><br />Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix - OMG - completely addictive!!  Gotta watch out for these if you're on a diet.  You'll want to gobble up the whole batch!<br /><br />Beth's All Purpose Flour - quick & easy to use for all your baking (including those homemade muffins).<br /><br />Spice Cake and Gingerbread Mix - delicious - and sooooo easy - I can prepare it faster than it takes my oven to heat up.  (Isn't that one of the BEST reason for buying a mix?)  I add additional cinammon, nutmeg, ginger - we like it that way.<br /><br />Coffee Cake Mix - fantastic - and EASY - the crumble topping is included.  Wonderful for a breakfast treat and NOT just for Celiacs.<br /><br />So that's about it.  Try it - you may like it. Hey - that's what makes horse racing! But don't buy a whole case in the event that you don't.<br /><br />Regards to all you brave Celiacs out there.  Let's hope that someday science can find a solution for us to make our lives a little easier.  In the meantime, heaven bless these fabulous companies for providing us with these products.\n",

      "I have recently gotten a Persian Cat from a Breeder.  She is 6 yrs. old and I noticed she was not eating well.  She was skin and bones when I got her.  She would have trouble picking up each piece of dry food and then she would drop it down on her food/drink mat.  I went on-line and finally found some helpful information about Persians.  They indeed have an eating problem in picking up the dry food.<br /><br />Cat food manufacturers are now selling food that is made specifically for Persians.  This food is flatter & almond shaped and has a texture that is easier for Persians to eat. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HALT80\">Royal Canin Dry Cat Food, Indoor Mature 27 Formula, 5.5-Pound Bag</a> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00068K5UQ\">Royal Canin Dry Cat Food, Indoor Adult 27 Formula, 15-Pound Bag</a><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010748DM\">Royal Canin Dry Cat Food, Indoor Light 40 Formula, 15-Pound Bag</a>  Royal Canin is one of these manufacturers.

      "------------------\n",
      "I am feeding her this currently while mixing it with the Innova (which is very expensive and hard to find) that her breeder is feeding her. I love that the price is slightly less than other premium, holistic foods and I can get it shipped to me on Prime 2 day shipping.  It's also for all life stages, so I like that if this continues to work for her, I won't need to switch to a different food as she gets older.<br /><br />The ingredients in the food are great, and I especially like that there are pro-biotics.  Because the nutrients are so concentrated, I know that one of these 35 pound bags is going to last me a very long time with one growing puppy. At the same time, I had a difficult time getting her to eat the food (I guess it just didn't smell appealing to her).  I have had to mix it with a little pureed pumpkin and a tablespoon of the Canidae canned food of the same variety to make it a bit more appealing. At the same time, this could just have to do with my picky Lhasa-Shih's taste buds and not the food.  I know that several people who use the premium food are thrilled at the small amount of stool.  Personally, my puppy has still had larger stools at least twice a day (some of this could be from the Innova which she is being weaned off of).  Lhasa's are known for having sensitivities to allergens, and I love that this food is so gentle on her stomach.<br /><br />Mostly, I love that this is carried by Amazon and it can get to my house so quickly and easily. It is hard enough for me to pick up a 35 pound bag of dog food while I'm putting it in a plastic bin (let alone carrying home from the store as I live in a metropolitan area where I take public transit).

Thinking all apple cider vinegar was the same, I went and bought the main brand sold from my local supermarket (not Briggs). After finding it very strong and sour and difficult to drink even when diluted, I googled to see how others tackled this and came across the Bragg brand. After trying it out, I can say that it is like night and day compared with the other one. Much more easy to drink and easily dilutes with other drinks. I probably would have given up the whole idea of taking apple cider vinegar if it wasn't for the improved taste and ease at which the general flavor can be diluted of the Bragg brand. As to whether or not it has done anything for me health-wise is a different question all together. Can't say for sure, but if you are going to take apple cider vinegar, I can say that this one was a winner for me.\n",

      "I picked this up at a local supermarket today after recently watching an advertisement on TV. Man, they got me good. Once you flip the top, it has one of those \"no mess\" type nozzles that squirts out only as long as pressure is applied to the bottle. Kinda neato. In terms of the actual taste and flavor, I used 8oz of water and initially, one half-second squirt of Mio Liquid Berry Pomegranate flavoring. I stirred it for a bit, and after much heart-wrenching anticipation, I was...not overly impressed. The initial resembling taste that I could recall would closely mimic that of Propel Water. It has a similar after taste after smacking the lips and tongue a bit.<br /><br />I found that if you really want it to be flavored water and not water with a hint of flavor, you have to use much longer squirts. I tried a one-second squirt, and my water tasted much better. I could really taste the berry and pomegranate flavoring, but not impressive enough to have a second glass. It advertises 24 servings per bottle, but I can't imagine what little flavor you will be tasting if you really tried to stretch it to 24 servings. In my case, maybe more like 10-12.<br /><br />My dealbreaker with this is that it provides no nutritional supplementation (i.e., antioxidants, vitamins, electrolytes, etc.), such as Propel, Vitamin Water, etc. So it really does just enhance the flavor of water. Seriously? I never thought water tasted that bad to begin with. But for mutants that have a hard time knocking back their non-flavored daily H20, this might do the trick. It's kind of cool to try out of novelty, and it definitely doesn't taste bad (they also have a plethora of yummy-delicious sounding flavors). But other than that, I can't imagine this being a household item. This is definitely not as cool as the bad boy putting is his pocket carrying with him around, as the commercial depicted. But one day if this does have nutritional supplementation, then watch out, because it's gonna be epic.\n",

After much waiting and always searching the stores I got online to track this down.  I found it here but in large vending machine quantity.  That is the reason it lost one star.  I still have several big bags of this in my closet.  Guess I'm good to go for a while!  I have found to help keep this fresh I use an old plastic Nestle Quik container.  One bag fills it right up.<br /><br />This lost the second star for the product itself.  First I find this much weaker than it used to be in the tins.  I have to add more to each cup to get the right flavor.  Second this is Very chalky and Very Very powdery.  I can taste the powder in it which before I could not.  I even tend to have a powdery residue at the bottom of my cup as well.  This may be because this was for a machine or something so it has a slightly different consistency.  Although about the time this was leaving the shelves of stores I noticed a change in several of the other flavors.  All of which were changing slightly in ways like that.  That was also when they started making some of their lattes foam up.  So I don't know if this changed during that time as well.<br /><br />Simply, this fills the void that was left since I no longer find it on the shelves.  Its not a perfect match to what I fell in love with but it is definitely still tasty. I would order it again to have it and probably will whenever the day comes when I run out again.\n",

If you are a fan of marzipan, (and there doesn't seem to be a lot of us out there,) Niederegger is the highest quality, most moist, not-overly sweet, delectable marzipan I have EVER come across, and that's out of all the marzipan I've tried during travels in Europe throughout my life. This stuff cannot be beat. The problem with most marzipan you find here in the States is it's almost always the ludicrously too sugary, kind of stiff decorative stuff that usually comes moulded into fruit forms. That stuff might look fun to a kid, but it's no good. Niederegger is for the true marzipan-lover! I only wish I could find more actual candy stores that will carry it, but it lieu of that, Amazon will do, and this seller sent these loaves with ridiculous speed, and they are so fresh, they honestly taste like I just visited Niederegger's marzipan-making facilities in Lubeck, Germany and asked for a sample.

      "------------------\n",
      "I have had the worst time finding oatcakes over the years.  I would occasionally find some but they were almost always the sweetened kind - which are also good, but not what I wanted.<br /><br />I can see that some people might be puzzled over the adoration some of us have for oatcakes.  Basically, they are simple crackers made of oats.  You might best describe them as rustic.  Which is the charm.<br /><br />If you've never had them, I would say the closest common product to compare them to might be graham crackers.  However, oatcakes are denser, less sweet, less soft, and less crumbly.  They are slightly more chewy, and possess more texture.  Imagine taking steel-cut oats and rolling them out into very thin, flat crackers.  So, these are slightly less brittle than regular crackers, resulting in less flaking, breaking or crumbling.  They are sturdy, holding up to toppings and handling.<br /><br />In these boxes, the crackers are cellophane wrapped in sets of 7, which is nice since it keeps them from going stale.  Because oats are high in fiber, these are more filling than you might think, and each oatcake is a nice, largish size-maybe a little bigger than a regular saltine cracker (and round, of course).  So you will probably get a goodly number of servings per box.<br /><br />These go well with all sorts of toppings, and are great plain too if you just need something with your coffee or tea etc. to deal with a stomach pang but don't really feel like anything fancy.  I think a lot of people would like this for breakfast for that reason.  I often get up in the morning and don't want to eat a meal, but just want a little something simple and plain.  These are a healthy good choice for that.<br /><br />I haven't tried using them for other things, like cracker crumb coatings, but I can't see any reason why you couldn't experiment with using these for things like that which you would use regular crackers for.  I think they would make a really nice rustic crumb pie crust or cobbler topping for either sweet or savory pies, for example.\n",

So when we wanted to switch our cat Caesar from Iam's and saw this on sale, I figured that I was getting quite a bargain.  Oh the folly...<br /><br />Chicken by-product meal, Corn grits and corn meal are three of the four top ingredients.  This is what the high cost buys - by-products and corn?  If we wanted to continue giving him crappy ingredients then we'd have kept buying Iams and saved the cash (not to mention the fact that Caesar actually liked it)!  I imagine the weight-loss claim is probably true, because my cat would eat just enough of this to get by...he hated it!  We decided to change to a new brand after half a bag, phasing the new food in with the Eukanuba  in growing proportions.  Throughout this short period, the kibble from the other brand was always gone first.<br /><br />If Caesar had liked it, I probably wouldn't stick with it on principle...I don't think I should pay top-dollar for substandard ingredients.  Luckily, Caesar came to that conclusion all by himself!\n",

Not in a good way, either.<br /><br />I don't usually put sugar or milk in any of my tea-- I am one of those people who drinks strong black chais straight up. So this is a complete killer for me. If you like super sweet teas, this may be for you, but I don't understand why they would put a sweetener in their tea.

But, overall, its a very good mix and easy to make.  There is some prep time involved with mincing garlic, onion, ginger, etc. But it's not hard to do.  You can also reduce the recipe by half and use half a package of seasoning (still use one whole can of tomato sauce but little or no water) and it comes out great.  The mix is set up to use 2 lbs of chicken which is a lot for one or two people.  Also, since the packet lists all of the ingredients, if you are a half way decent cook you can  buy the spices in bulk and save money by mixing it yourself.\n",

I went to the next jar.  It is still safety sealed and unopened.  I peeled off the paper label from the outside of the jar, and inside the sealed jar there is a hair!  It looks like it could be a rat hair, but I have not tested it obviously.  I do hope the FDA will test it--I am contacting them in the morning.  This second jar also has numerous scratches in the glass--approximately 20 scratches, many of them black (dirt in the scratched glass).  The company was not at all concerned--they just told me if I didn't purchase it directly from them, I should ask amazon for a refund.  I explained that the main point of my call was certainly not for a refund but to protect consumers from DANGER!  They called me back and said IF I returned their jars, they would replace the salt.  I refused the replacement and am hoping the FDA will examine the jars.  It is a little alarming that Amazon has no procedure for pulling the salt from its shelves and checking the remaining jars.

      "If you love green tea then you will be impressed with this green tea powder. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of cold water but I'd recommend you try two packets and one packet (0.35 oz) of stevia. The flavor of the tea with only one packet is fairly mild, so mild in fact that you can barely taste the green tea flavor. When you order this tea you will get six boxes with 12 packets in each. If you use two packets per bottle of water you get 36 drinks. That is only .47 cents per drink if you get free shipping - I ordered some books too. I think that is fairly reasonable. I look forward to trying this tea in shakes and with fruit juices. A website is given for additional recipes. There are a few interesting recipes like the ones for \"White Chocolate Green Tea Ice Cream,\" \"Green Tea Papaya Nectar\" and \"Green Tea Sugar Cookies.\" You will probably find many uses for this and I've even used the tea powder to make a lovely hot tea. Just use one packet per 8 ounces of hot water. No brewing required. This tea dissolves very easily in hot or ice cold water. I can highly recommend it to you.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review\n",

      "Was wanting dehydrated/dried mushrooms in thoughts of putting them in my Japanese clear soup...but even after simmering for an hour and waiting until the next day to eat the soup the mushrooms were still far to chewy and hard for my liking. Im going to try them in a fried meal and also try baking them to see if either of those methods helps obtain a decent texture. As of right now though Im not that impressed and wont likely purchase these again.\n",

I had to buy 12 bottles but it won't go to waste.  It was a fantastic deal and worth every penny to me.\n",

      "I've noticed that quite a few people don't seem to believe the labels of products made in China, when it is usually a U.S. company that dictates what goes into the product.  Besides read the labels of products made right here--a vast majority of them contain toxic to humans & animals ingredients--everything from paint & varnish to the food is tainted with these toxic chemicals & all made right here in the U.S.A.  So, if you can trust a U.S. label--why not trust a Chinese label?  These treats are sure a hit with our dogs--all 7 of them love the chicken, lamb & rice, & the duck with glucosamine & chrondroitin.  We buy this type because of our older dogs with severe arthritis.  Our 15 yr. old was almost beyond walking until we started feeding him these snacks & our 9 yr. old Chihuahua's hip problems are much improved. On S&S these snacks are the cheapest price that we have found & with free shipping--Keep 'em coming Dogswell & Amazon--yes, even from the dreaded China.\n",

      "These mango slices are just the most lovely, tasty and healthy ever! They are less yellow than the photo represents. But, that is only to be expected in non-sulfured and organic dried fruits. They are also without the additional added sugar of all other types of dried mangoes. These slices are naturally sweet and have a lovely chewy and easy to consume texture.<br /><br />The lack of the sulfur and added sugar reveals the fresh, subtle and delightful taste of a \"real\" mango. I found myself gorging on these and had to restrain myself, in order to prevent their disappearance on the day of their arrival in my home. Eat these as they are, grind them with pineapple and banana to make a delightful and fresh-tasting Smoothie. Alternatively- add chopped bits of the dried mangoes to your baking, as with scones, gingerbread cake, or healthful cookies. You won't be disappointed with these lovely slices of dried mango.<br /><br />They are expensive, but well worth the price, especially considering all of their healthy contributions to your daily diet. The shipper was responsive, the slices were very well-packaged and arrived far in advance ot their estimated date of delivery. This is a no-brainer! I highly recommend these mango slices to one and all.\n",

There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: \"Jasmine tea is the oldest known scented tea, and ours begins its life in the gardens of Hunan Province. The rich soil and fluctuations in daily temperature yield a fragrant leaf which is further scented with delicate white Jasmine blossoms. During summer, these are gathered daily by the banks of the Min River and repeatedly mated each night with the prepared tea, naturally embracing all of the flowers' scent. When brewed, this smooth, organic green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight. It is a most romantic tea, and, like a bowl of fresh picked flowers, will bring the joy of summer to your every sip.\" It sounds quite romantic, and it tastes wonderful. It is a true jasmine tea, and the taste of jasmine predominates, in a both strong and lovely way.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry.

I told my daughter my concerns, but she said she would try it and let her children try it as well!<br />  They found nothing wrong with it!<br />  It was very tasty as I said, but I can not of good conscience recommend this as a healthy snack!  It is extremely sweet and children should be where they can brush their teeth after eating it! Which they would not be able to do at school!  I would not want whatever that tiny hard thing I bit on[maybe a hard grain] to chip a child's tooth. The adult should try it first to see if they want their child have this either as a for snack for school or for outside playing!<br />  As I said it was very tasty, but it was hard and just to to sweet! I first gave it 5 stars, but I felt I was not being honest when I am trying to eat as healthy as I can! I will not buy this product for my grandchildren nor for me again! And I love nuts/grains/fruits and all the Antioxidants this product offers, but it is just too sweet and that out weighs any nutritional value you gain! If The maker would not have it so sweet as it is, then I would try it again and then could give it a better review!  Not everything that sounds healthy is healthy! We see all the healthy stuff and then think wow this is good for us, but we neglect to notice the larger amounts of fats or salts or sugars that has been added and then it is not as healthy as we thought! It is the fats/ salts/ and sugars that is destroying our bodies from the inside out!<br />Polar2[Eya-Andrea]\n",

I wanted them to get use to a better kind of litter and first tried the Yesterday's News only to have them avoid it like the plague.  Then I thought maybe they would like this if it had a natural fresh scent.  Hard to say because even when I put a little in one box with their regular litter, which is clay, only one of my 3 will even venture in only to hop right back out. I have 3 cats and have 4 boxes set up for them which are cleaned at least twice daily...I know I know, I'm a clean fanatic with that which they are happy about to be honest.  Anyway, this stuff is bright yellow and has an awful smell to it AND it is dusty!  The pieces are so big and I'm guessing it would be uncomfortable to walk on.  Anyway, I can't picture this one being a winner and will probably try the cedar chips as one last try.  After that, I think I'm done trying to fix something that isn't broken.

If they don't want to be eco friendly, heaven only knows I can't make them.<br /><br />UPDATE 12-31-2011:  After several weeks of trying to entice them to using this, I gave up.

It claims that it promotes normal blood pressure, provides restful sleep, promotes good heart health and increases muscle strength. However it has a nice taste and I enjoy drinking it.<br /><br />It certainly tastes a 100 times better than tap water and it tastes better that the average bottled water. There is only one brand that I like slightly better. One big difference about this water is the size of the bottle. The average bottled water is 16.9 oz. This bottle is 1.5L and it perfect for me. I usually drink a lot of bottled water when working outside in the heat or while exercising. I can down a regular bottle of water in a few seconds but this bottle will last me a while.<br /><br />The cost per bottle is a little on the high side but you have to factor in the size of the bottle. Each Essentia bottle is equal to 3 1/2 regular size bottles. That being said the cost is still a little on the high side but that is the case with all of the higher quality bottled waters.\n",

      "Had this product for about 2 weeks now. Not particularly satisfied as of yet. Like others have stated the problem with leakage is annoying & makes a mess, not to mention a weaker brew. Tried pulling the rubber seal/grommet down to account for an apparent gap between the Keurig coffee maker and the K-cap. This seemed to help a little but not enough to keep me from having to place a dishcloth under my coffee mug to avoid a bigger, longer clean-up. Haven't tried the foil trick yet because I've discovered that trick works very well with the My K-cup device, without having to buy pre-packaged K-cups, use them once, clean them out, let them dry, use the K-cap, adjust the seal, clean the mess...<br /><br />I'm not sure whether to send the K-caps back or keep troubleshooting until I find a solution. Since placing the foil on the My K-cup filter prior to putting on the plastic lid works as well with my Keurig coffee maker as the pre-packaged K-cups I probably wont have a need for the K-caps.<br /><br />p.s. I still purchase the pre-packaged K-cups since some of them have outstanding flavor. I just don't discard them in my trash can. *HINT* They recycle nicely after removing the foil & filter.\n",

This is not necessarily a negative, as I definitely expected something with spirulina in it to taste very green and earthy, banana just takes over anything it touches and it has done so here as well. I wanted more of the spriulina/sesame seed taste i suppose.<br /><br />I think this is a great company and despite the high price tag of goods such as these, it's still lower than storefront retail and seems to be VERY high quality.

Peanuts, almonds, sunflower seeds with just the right combination of chocolate or vanilla makes these a perfect spread, snack or staple. Like most Baby Boomers, I grew up on one or more of the mainstream brands of peanut butter mixed with jam, spread on toast or scooped with a stick of celery. While one or more of these traditional peanut butters can still be found on my shelf, they are slowly but surely being replaced by Wild Squirrel nut butters. While Vanilla Espresso Almond Butter and Chocolate Sunflower Seed Almond Butter are my particular favorites, I would highly recommend sampling them all which has been made even easier with the addition of single serve pouches. If your looking to expand your peanut butter palate or just want something new to replace the majority of over-salted or sugary snacks, Wild Squirrel Nut Butters provide some highly recommended alternatives.\n",

Adding some milk, I found that the cereal was very nicely balanced and has a very healthy taste.  That means that I felt good after eating it and not weighed down.  As for the technical nutritional facts, the ingredients and stats are listed here (a nice thing about Amazon).  The absence of high fructose corn syrup and the basic natural ingredients are quite reassuring, but, as with all granolas I've seen, portion control will be needed to keep the calorie count down (220 per half cup).  I found the texture quite good for cereal, crumbly bits and all, which is how I eat it.  It may be a bit messy for casual consumption by hand.<br /><br />Overall, this is really basic.  It would be quite inexpensive and easy to make this yourself.  That is not a bad thing, though.

It's also loaded with sodium, which most jerky is, but it really *tastes* salty too. The meat is tender because it was tenderized with papain which is an enzyme in papayas (thanks Wikipedia) there does seem to be a good amount of gristly threads running through it.

As with switching any food you should ween the dog off the old food by adding a mixture of the old and new or you will have a MESS.  She loves this food much more than the Eukanuba.  I would have rated the product 5 star but this food does give her awful gas (due to higher protein content, I think) and her breathe doesn't smell the best.  I've been able to combat the breath with \"fresh breath\" dog treats.  The gas can be helped, not solved, by an assortment of candles, sprays, etc.  I will continue to buy this food and have it delivered to my house via Amazon.

      "I grew up in New York City, and fondly remember the jingle, \"Conta-dina...tomato...sauce....New York's...best...selling...brand!\"<br /><br />This is Contadina Tomato PASTE, of course, not the sauce -- but it's made by the same people, and, unlike the tomato sauce, I have actually tried the Contadina Tomato PASTE.<br /><br />Tomato paste is similar in all brands.  Look at the ingredient panel.  The ingredient (usually), is just \"tomatoes\".  The only exception are brands like \"Muir Glen\", (also sold on Amazon.com), which is Organic. (Sadly, \"Del Monte\"-a large corporation -- also sold organic tomato paste for a while, but no longer does.  Please sell it again, Del Monte -- and I, and I'm sure many others -- will buy it!)<br /><br />In the meantime, Contadina tomato paste is as good as any other.  In some ways, it is preferable to other brands. Why?  Well, one reason is the picture on the can.  Instead of just tomatoes, as other brands have, Contadina tomato paste features a pretty lady, and in the background, an Italian tomato grove.  It's buildings seem beautiful, and somewhat mysterious, as Italian buildings sometimes are.  If one is of a creative mind-set, looking at these buildings, (and the pretty lady), could, possibly, be the start of an interesting story to write...which might even become a best-seller and featured on Amazon!<br /><br />A more practical reason why (another type of) Contadina tomato sauce might be purchased is this:  Contadina ALSO makes, (in 6 ounce cans), an \"Italian Style\" tomato paste.  Though not the item featured here, it is certainly something to look for....hopefully, in the future on Amazon, and right now, in your local supermarket or warehouse store.  \"Italian Style\" Contadina tomato paste, in addition to mainly consisting of tomatoes, ALSO has a few spices and herbs.  These (to me), expertly chosen and blended herbs, add to the flavouring, and make for a tastier dish!<br /><br />As for the plain tomato paste being reviewed here, it's as good as any other brand -- plus you get that nice picture on the label.  It's not organic -- but it IS all-natural.  Just tomatoes.  The 12-ounce size means you don't have to open the can as often, you have plenty, (if you are preparing more than 2 servings at a time), and a 12-ounce can, because of it's size, will probably last longer on the shelf than a 6-ounce can, as smaller amounts of any food will spoil faster than larger amounts.<br /><br />Tomato PASTE -any brand -- is, I think, far more economical than tomato sauce.  Tomato sauce usually includes \"water\" as an ingredient, and most people can add that themselves!  Diluted, and with different ingredients added, tomato paste can become tomato soup, tomato juice...even tomato sauce!  If you don't want the bother of growing and/or canning your own tomatoes, just buying tomato PASTE at the store seems an economical, tasty, and very easy-to-prepare choice!<br /><br />\"Contadina Tomato Sauce -- New York's Best-Selling Brand.\"  I haven't heard that jingle in quite a while...so it might not be true any more.  Still, this is inexpensive, and quite delicious tomato paste.  Not organic...but all natural.  With that \"possibly imagination-engedering\" picture on the can, it is, I think, quite a good choice!\n",

A word of warning, do not rinse the oats, just pour in the water, set for porridge, press start, and walk away!  I am used to rinsing rice and did that with the oats, and it was really dry, not at all oatmeal.<br />If your rice cooker has a timer, you can set it up the night before too.<br /><br />Using a rice cooker makes cooking steel cut oats more convenient than cooking instant oatmeal on the stove.

Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).\n",

Wet food does make him urinate more (he used to get a dry/wet mix of Urinary SO prescription diet), but I am glad, because this should help to keep his urinary tract healthy.<br /><br />I researched various options before settling on this one. Among other brands (wet food only), he wouldn't even touch \"Organix;\" he likes \"Evo\" fine, but not as much as Newman's own and leaves one-third of food uneatten in the bowl. As far as other flavors of Newman's own, he didn't like the Brown rice flavor (too much rice--the cat kept picking out individual grains out of his food one by one), and strangely, after eating a few cans of store-bought Chicken&Salmon flavor, he refused to eat the same flavor from Amazon.\n",

Its easy to chew probably because it tasted too mushy and soft. The reason why i gave it a 2 star instead of 1 star is because it's was going for a good price. Overall, I wouldn't buy this beef stick because it taste mushy and sour, I'm sure it's not expired because  it says feb 2013. I knew i should've gotten the peperoni flavor beef sticks. Also, from all the other people's review i was expecting a sample from them since i read a lot of people received samples. I was kinda disappointed.

      "New Bags Pop Terrible (Was: Best Microwave Popcorn)\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "Updated Review: January 31, 2010<br />--------------------------------<br />The original review below was for black Jewel popcorn that I purchased about 6 months ago from Amazon.  After loving that one we bought a second case.<br /><br />In the second case, the popcorn kernels seems the same but the microwave bags are completely different.  The new bags are brown in color and say: \"Being conscientious of our environment we have chosen to use unbleached natural paper microwave bags\".  (The old bags were white and felt like all other microwave popcorn bags.)<br /><br />The problem is that the new bags are VERY inconsistent in how they pop the corn.  In the same microwave that we used with the previous bags, you now either get half unpopped kernels AND/OR burned popcorn.  This is with the same amount of cooking time and settings as before.  (We tried varying the time/wattage and it is even inconsistent between bags with the same settings.  i.e. It will burn at 2:10 on one bag and on the next bag won't be half-popped at 2:10.)<br /><br />I can't be 100% sure that it is the bags but:<br />1) We didn't have this issue before with the old case.<br />2) Of the kernels that pop without burning they taste the same as before.<br />3) Visually the bags appear to be the only change.<br /><br />We've almost ran thru all 18 microwave bags that come in the case...  (At least 15 of them.)  Getting half popped corn or having to throw the bag of burned corn the rest of the time.  This issue has happened for ALL of the bags we've tried to pop with the new brown bags.<br /><br />I guess we'll try just buying the loose kernels since they ruined the microwave version.<br /><br />NOTE:  Our microwave is not much more than 6 months old...  So I don't think it is that.<br /><br />Original Review (5 stars): January 10, 2010 (Before we opened the new case)<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />Simple Review:  This is the best microwave popcorn we've found.  My wife is a popcorn nut and she's tried everything you can get in the stores and many of the online brands...  (She even likes this better than the kind you pop on the stove.)<br /><br />Microwaving Tip:  If you have a 1200+ Watt microwave cut the power back to 80% or more.  You'll get better tasting and more consistent popcorn.  (An Inverter Microwave is better at this since it cleanly cuts to 80%.  It isn't on 80% then off 20% of the time like old microwaves.)<br /><br />We have a 1250 Watt Panasonic Inverter microwave.  At 100% power it will burn at around 2:10 or sometimes less.  (I won't put any other times in here.  You have to determine the best setting for your microwave.)<br /><br />So cut the power back and find the right time for your microwave...  It makes a significant difference in taste & consistency.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

If you want an Earl Grey that doesn't hold back on the bergamont, and don't mind some extra tannins, I'd suggest Rishi or Tazo.  If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing, go for Stash Double Bergamont.  I think it includes grapefruit flavoring (just my perception).  Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great, and includes small blue flowers, which you can see in the loose leaf version.  Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves.\n",

      "I've probably been consuming Starburst candies since they were invented and have tried every one of their flavors throughout the years.  This flavor, Morph, is their best one yet!  And yes, the flavor DOES change (morphs) half-way through the chewing.  Very, very YUMMY!!!!<br /><br />I wish that Starburst would add even more flavors, since the Morph only has orange and strawberry.  Why not make a grape-morphing-to-raspberry candy, or a green-apple-morphing-to-cherry selection?  Or a sweet-and-sour morph?  The sky's the limit!\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "I'm a left-coaster and we don't see Tastykake products, nor being a near vegan do I indulge normally.  Anyway, the appearance of the product was too compelling and I splurged on an order of these.<br /><br />The picture here, for those fellow un-initiates, is misleading.  It is not like a Hostess pie or a turnover, it's an actual little pie in it's own tiny aluminum pie pan!  The crust is a bit salty, and naturally is not crisp or flaky after being in contact with the filling in a small box all that time, but it is very tasty.  The filling is also not overflowing the casing, like the picture, at best it at least fills the lower crust, but sometimes not.<br /><br />That's just so you have the proper expectations, not meant as a criticism really, because this nasty little devil is great, really excellent.  Miles and miles above the Hostess pies (although it's been twenty years since I tried one), really no comparison at all.  If you're in the mood for something special, check it out.  Shipping was super fast, despite the conservative Azon estimates, so gratification in the near term is guaranteed.<br /><br />If someone franchised this product and got it into supermarkets with the neat little boxes in a rack near the checkout line (to compete with candy bars), they'd sell MILLIONS of these puppies.\n",

THAT, my friends, is a true shame, because the flavor itself is quite nice.<br />The sweetness comes from sucralose, the 'Splenda' sweetener. I'm not getting into the debate about sucralose, this is a review for a product that contains it, and most consumers have a viewpoint on it already. All I ask is, why must every artificially sweetened product be OVERLY sweetened? I believe the American palate is changing, and MIO needs to catch up with us.\n",

Use 12 minutes if the dough is cold. *<br /><br />Allow the cookies to sit on cookie sheet for about 10 minutes before moving to a cooling rack. They will appear a little soft when they come out of the oven but will set up as they sit.<br /><br />Pamela's baking mix contains: brown rice flour, white rice flour, cultured buttermilk, natural almond meal, tapioca starch, sweet rice flour, potato starch, grainless & aluminum-free baking powder, baking soda, sea salt and xanthan gum.<br /><br />Each 1/3 cup of mix provides 160 calories, 3.5 grams fat (zero trans fat), 5 mg cholesterol, 390mg sodium, 27 grams carbs, 1.5 g fiber, 3 g sugar, 4 grams protein, 10% calcium and 2% iron.<br /><br />If you want to really review how good this product is, I suggest reading the reviews on Amazon.

      "I love the liquid combo of pomegranate and blueberry, and V8's version is probably healthier than most because it contains ten grams of sugar in an eight-ounce can. I'm not saying that's a low amount of sugar, but it's probably lower than the sugar content within most brands, which taste much sweeter (and, regrettably, a bit better than this stuff). V-Fusion drinks typically have a sweet, fruity taste, yet you can always catch the hint of vegetable mix within.<br /><br />Like all V8 products, this can of V-Fusion is loaded with good stuff: a combined serving of fruit and vegetables; green tea extract; and lots of vitamins. It's labeled as an energy drink and contains a caffeine level of eighty milligrams, just ten less than an eight-ounce cup of coffee. Weirdly enough, after drinking a can of V-Fusion at night after a long day, I didn't feel energized in the least (maybe because I'm a coffee drinker and immune to \"natural caffeine\" that comes from green tea extract). At any rate, this is a good, healthy drink that would be a nice alternative to other overly sweet fruit drinks. I'd recommend it, along with V-8's other Fusion concoctions.\n",

I use this coffee as a drip-grind coffee, not French-press or expresso where so many people love it. It's still 5 stars!<br /><br />This coffee is excellent: it's called a dark roast but it tastes more like a medium or medium-dark roast and doesn't have much bitter/burnt taste so common in such roasts. It's woody with a hint of a citrusy taste. It's a little creamy and earthy. There's a considerable complexity of tastes which reminds me of Eight O'Clock's Bocar Blend, but Bocar is not as bold - but it is around 2/3 the price.  Eight O'Clock's Columbian (my most-brewed in the AM coffee) is as bold with a little less complexity and a more woody taste, again at 2/3 the price. It most closely reminds me of Starbuck's Caffe Verona, which is a little more chocolately in taste and is usually around $8 for one about same sized bag at Amazon.\n",

      "Last year we got our first family dog- a rescue JRT-mix.  My family had so much fun with Charlie-Amanda that we soon adopted another pooch, Pippin.  If you're wondering why I'm telling you all this, it's so that you have the background on where I'm coming from with respects to this review.  Essentially we love our pups and I spent a lot of time last year reading up on dog foods.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />The 15.5 pound bag of Beneful dog food comes nicely packaged.  It was delivered in a box that was appropriately sized.  The Beneful bag itself is super sturdy, plasticized, and has what looks to be a sturdy 'ziplock' opener at the top.  This is just the sort of thing you need with a large amount of kibble to keep it fresh and appealing to dogs.  So bonus points here (although the superior option would be biodegradable).<br /><br />THE KIBBLE:<br />The kibble is attractive and smells okay.  There are different sizes, shapes, textures, and colors.<br /><br />MY DOGS REACTION:<br />As I mentioned, I've got two pups.  One's a year old JRT-mix and the other's a 8 month-old Moyen-sized poodle.  They both thought that the food smelled interesting, but they didn't chow it down.  They would eat quite a bit if I hand fed them the kibble, but they'd only eat out of the bowl if they were very hungry.  In fairness I should note that they are the pickiest eaters in the universe, and sometimes they'll even turn their noses up at human chicken and hot dogs.  I expect most dogs would eat this food.  Certainly our neighbor's dog, who is always breaking into the house to scour it clean, gulped down every little tidbit.<br /><br />NUTRITION:<br />--Much research has led me to understand that it can be difficult to calculate the actual price of a dog food.  \"Cheap\" dog foods, for example, may not be as cheap as they seem because dogs need to eat more of lower quality food than higher quality.  If you look at this example you'll see what I mean.  The Beneful package suggests that a dog of 15 pounds should eat around 1.25-to-1.7 cups of food per day.  A similarly sized dog need only eat 1 cup of Eukanuba small breed kibble.  Now Eukanuba appears to be more expensive per bag, but is it?<br /><br />My point is that those of us who are frugal need to crunch the numbers before they purchase.<br /><br />--Beneful is a low quality food source for dogs.  Dogs are omnivores but they really need protein and the first ingredients for Beneful are ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour.  Compare their 25% protein product with what I'm currently feeding my dogs which has 32% protein, and whose ingredients are Chicken, Chicken By-products and Corn meal.  And there are other products out there with even higher protein levels.<br /><br />--Keep in mind that some dogs are allergic to corn and food dyes.  If your pup is one of these, skip Beneful.<br /><br />CONTROVERSY:<br />--There's a number of controversies surround Beneful and it's manufacturer, Nestl&eacute; Purina.  The parent company, Nestl&eacute;, has been involved in a number of recalls for both human and pet foods.  They use ingredients from China for the dog food, and there are many complaints against them in 2012 for dog treats.<br /><br />--The Dog Food Advisor website gives Beneful 1-Star for high fat and carbohydrate levels.<br /><br />CONCLUSIONS<br />Beneful is an okay product.  It's the type of dog food that my grandmother would have purchased in bulk to feed the strays she was always taking in.  It is VERY convenient to have it delivered, and the packaging is excellent, and for some people who have a difficult time getting out of the house, this is going to be a great option.<br /><br />Currently Beneful appears to be safe to use.  Nestl&eacute;'s reputation is not sterling however and dog owners should keep an eye to the news for recalls and reports of poisons since Purina uses foodstuffs from China.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom and fur-mom\n",

Because of that, he was becoming underweight and I decided to switch him away from dry kibble to have him gain some weight first before worrying bout his picky taste.<br />However when I give him ziwipeak, he would finish it up right away!<br /><br />This brand is expensive, but based upon the amounts you feed, it isn't really that much expensive if you have a small dog. I have a 2 pound puppy that is expected to mature at about 4-5 pounds, and the costs is about 25cents extra a day. If you have a big dog that's gonna gobble up 1/3 of a bag or more a day, then that will be a lot more expensive for you.<br /><br />But......<br />The quality of food and the fact that it is in a jerky meat form makes it a lot better than eating hard dry kibble all day long.<br />Anyone would be bored of eating biscuits everyday for his entire life :/<br /><br />The quality of this food is unsurpassed.<br />There have been no problems at all with this food at all as well either. No recalls, all made in New Zealand as well.<br /><br />Something that I tell a lot of people.<br />Spend more on food daily, and not risk the possibility of having a sick dog due to some pet food recall. Vet bills are going to cost you a few thousand dollars.<br />Expensive dog food will probably add up to the same cost as most over the duration of your dog's life, unless you have a really big dog.<br />So instead of having to go through the grief of having a puppy in pain, and you undergoing mental and emotional stress, why not just give it a food that is good and safe and something that the dog enjoys, and spare yourself from all that unnecessary trouble?<br /><br />Yes times are hard and most people are having difficulty putting dinner on the table for themselves or their kids. So there are situations where foods like this are just too much to afford.<br />So unless if your budget really is a problem, I would recommend this food to anyone!\n",

These things are packaged as \"gourmet,\" are from a small company that made me believe it was some small but caring mom-and-pop company, and who doesn't love flan?  I can't see how these are gourmet considering how bad they taste, maybe the company is caring but the cookies don't taste like it, and the best things about flan are the texture and the decadent sweet fatty taste.  You don't get any of it with this.<br /><br />These cookies taste like there's too much flour.  They're like butter cookies where someone took out 1/2 the sugar and put in too much flour.  It's got a pasty texture and the taste doesn't compare to real flan.  The closest comparison I can give is they taste like bad shortbread. If figure if something is going to be close to flan in cookie-form, it's got to be real flan put into some type of pastry to keep it from falling apart.  These cookies are just pasty and dry.\n",

I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad. But I would try something else, stay away from this one.\n",

However, the good news is that everyone we gave some to from the first case reported back that their cats loved it and they were going to keep using it.

I think this product is a masterpiece, taste-wise and texture-wise. The only obstacles for my family to buying from this brand often are the price and the presence of some added sugar (relatively little though, judging by the numbers on their labels; I just wanted to point out that agave nectar is especially high in fructose, the \"worst\" of \"simple sugars\", and this brand uses some agave nectar - hopefully very little).

I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM.

I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.\n",

      "Excuse the title quote from the SciFi series LEXX, but I thought it appropriate.  This stuff was very good, someone who helped sample it made a key statement, that the broccoli actually tasted fresh.  I guess in the little sealed packet it hydrates better than the completely dried out mix they have in some other packaged dinners.  I do recommend something for novice cooks that worked well here. Despite all the flavors here, the chicken should be the star of this dish.  I learned something many years ago in Vancouver about how chicken should be prepared, and it's true.  Now you can't do this too far in advance, but as your searing the chicken you should season it too, and make a nice brown grill when completed.  The seasoning is seared in, along with the moisture and the flavor.<br /><br />In Vancouver there was a restaurant, part of a chain also in the US called the Bombay Bicycle Club.  They actually had one in my home town of Fort Wayne many years before, but then I didn't even know it was a restaurant.  I found out this chicken secret eating at the one in Vancouver.  I ordered a salad topped with grilled chicken breast, and when I tasted it I was just blown away.  I'd had these type of salads many times elsewhere, and mostly the chicken was just another run of the mill taste in the salad.  I asked the chef what the secret was, and to my surprise he told me.  People don't season the chicken right before the sear, and once seared it has a difficult time accepting any flavor.  Now I've made Tarragon chicken before, and I know that picks up the flavor of the spice, but not before baking for a few hours.<br /><br />To make a long story short, I seared it just like that, blended the cheese, broccoli, pasta with the chicken, and cooked as ordered.  It was great.  A good meal with nice a flavor contrast, and the chicken stayed the star of the dish.  I'll have to see what they charge for these retail, but if reasonable, I can see myself getting some more real soon.\n",

When I went to prepare my first cup I heated 16 oz of water to near boiling in the microwave, and added 2 pods to my cup and let it steep for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. That resulted in a weak but fairly tasty cup of coffee. You see, there are NO DIRECTIONS ANYWHERE ON THE BOX OR INDIVIDUAL PACKETS!<br /><br />I finally did a search on the internet and found the Marley website which explained these are coffee pods intended for use in a machine brewer. This would have been nice to know ahead of time. I don't even own a pod brewer. I ended up cutting open the pods and brewing them in my Bunn commercial coffee maker. The coffee is delicious this way but insanely expensive.<br /><br />I think if Marley provides some brewing instructions on the box and individual pods, this could be a good product as the coffee is very high quality, and rich and tasty.\n",

      "I have been drinking vitamin water and sobe Lifewater for awhile but that can get expensive so I started drinking just plain water, filtered from my fridge's water dispenser.  Plain water is so boring so when I saw this I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />First of all, remember that this is concentrated!  so you MUST mix it with water.  When I got it I wasn't really sure how big of a \"squeeze\" to put in.  It says on the label \"one squeeze per 8 oz water\"  - well, my first 'squeeze' I just did a full grip and squeezed until I couldn't squeen anymore.  For me that was a bit too much flavor and it tasted like Hawaiian Punch.  So the next time I backed off a bit and after a few uses I found a \"squeeze\" level that works for me tastes.<br /><br />I also like to add it to small bottles of water that I occasionally get from the store.  I just drink a little out of a 16.9oz water bottle then put in a squeeze of the Vitamin squeeze, shake it a bit and I've got a nice, flavorful and vitamin-enhanced drink.  I'm not too sure there are 24 servings in one bottle, maybe my squeeze is too much, but I've probably had at least a dozen water drinks with this one bottle and still have some left.  I'll try keeping tabs with the next bottle I open and update this review.<br /><br />Oh, I enjoyed the fruit punch so much that I decided to try the Acai Grape Pomegranate and the Tropical Citrus.  The Acai Grape Pomegranate is okay, but I think the Tropical Citrus and the Fruit punch are my favorites thus far.  The Tropical Citrus is a bit like \"Sunny Delight\" - if you've ever tried that.<br /><br />As for the claim of \"Specially designed cap delivers the right amount in one squeeze with no drips or mess\" - I would say again that you have to determine what \"one squeeze\" is to suit your taste and it definitely is no drips or mess!  A lot better than pouring those powder packets in to a bottle and getting the powder on your counter top or desk.\n",

I believe the same regarding the 1 pound Valrhona Chocolate Cocoa Powder, which you sell, versus Valrhona Cocoa Powder which you do not sell.  It is deceptive that you added the word chocolate after the brand name and sell to customers a product that is not the genuine product.  I just today opened my order of one of each of your products and found them to be of such low quality in a triple blind tasting with three tasters that I had to research what was wrong.  It wasn't until I went to the manufacturers' websites that I found the genuine products do not come packaged in one pound sizes, the size of your products.  It was my intention to purchase the Cook's Illustrated magazine's top rated cocoa powder, Callabaut. And try the highly recommended Valrhona cocoa powder.  The Valrhona product I purchased from your company was agreed by all three tasters to have an off taste that was chemically and unpalatable.  The Callabaut lacks richness, and other than its color, tastes nothing close to what one would define as chocolate in flavor.<br /><br />I am unhappy that I do not have the products I was so looking forward to receiving, and further I am quite put out that I now have to take my time to deal with returning your substandard products and wait to receive what I really thought I was ordering.

It's all bad news.  Amy's canned products all contain BPA.  This is unfortunate because Amy's recipes are good tasting.  Amy's is aware of the problem and have been \"researching it\" for years now.  But they can't seem to get around to removing this dangerous poison from their products.<br /><br />It's not worth the risk to yourself, your children, and your unborn children.  So please avoid this product and any other that contains BPA.  When Amy's does the right thing and stops using BPA in their canned products, they'll be fit to eat.  But not until then.\n",

      "The plants were exactly like the one pictured.  Each pot came with 3 stalks.  They arrived in good shape. While a bit pricey, they were quite full.  Shipping was reasonable, but that's because we ordered multiple plants, which cuts the shipping cost per plant significantly.<br /><br />They are planted in a potting mix that is a bit strange compared to what we usually see here in California. Looks like ground peat moss, but I can't say for sure. After watering the plants, they seem to dry out quickly, but we've had some rather hot weather here lately.  Maybe not peat moss.  We plan to move them into another pot with potting mix from around here.<br /><br />We have noticed a number of dropped leaves since they arrived. (2 weeks)  We know how to manage Aralias as we have over 10 currently around our house. (Ming, Fabian, False, and Parsley) So I'm not sure if it's just a change in location/climate or something else.<br /><br />These Parsley Aralias look somewhat different than the ones we bought about 8 years ago here in California. The leaves seem thicker and the plant is fuller. (Dense foliage) I'm not sure if it's due to different conditions/climate or fertilization, but they are not as light and airy looking as what we're used to.  We'll see over time if they change or stay the same.<br /><br />Overall.....a good purchase.\n",

Stick to the Foghouse blend - it's stronger and richer tasting than the other.  The cost is less, most likely because the plastic is missing.

      "I have to admit I was somewhat skeptical in deciding to purchase a bread mix brand that in all honesty I had never heard of.  However, after baking my first loaf in my automatic bread machine, I was shocked to find that the bread is as soft and light as a cloud! The outer crust maintains a perfect crispiness even though the inside remains airy days after baking, assuming your family hasn't gobbled it up by then! And the fresh bread aroma filling the house as it bakes is better than any of the plug-in air fresheners that we're all guilty of buying, especially when you add cinnamon to the mix! I've only tried the white mix thus far (best if adding spices to the baking cycles) so I can't address the other varieties but have to assume they're equally tasty and aromatic.  I have baked additional loaves for family and friends and they love it too! Looking forward to receiving future shipments of this \"Slice of Heaven.\"\n",

We've been back to pediatrician for well visits and fluid has been observed in her ears, but it's not turning into ear infections like before.  I would highly recommend this product.

The guilt of eating this much hasn't caught up with me yet.<br /><br />Yes, this granola is like crack. Yes, you will eat way more than one serving size. No, you should not just grab handfuls of this stuff out of the bag like I did if you care about how much you consume. Measure it people. I suggest, if you're tracking your calories like I am, to avoid entering how much you consume, because the numbers will only depress you if the carb monster in you comes out to play. My carb monster--and sweet tooth monster--both came out to play whenever I even SAW the bag lol. Today, I had about 1.5k calories from this granola--and that is not including the milk I consumed half of it with.<br /><br />Kind Snacks are awesome, and I am addicted to their Nut Delight Kind Bars. I have one every day I'm on my university's campus with a yogurt, and it is a filling snack/meal that keeps me satisfied for at least 3-5 hours.<br /><br />These grains are healthy, and what snacks should be like. Love that there's flax in here, and quinoa, millet, etc. They're great on yogurt, in some skim milk, and even better when eating them out of your hand. They're a little on the sweet side (it's 6g of sugar for 1/3 cup), so if you're trying to cut sugar out of your diet, I would suggest avoiding. Then again, they're sweet for me because I haven't really had sugary things in a while, so this was like a huge treat that I totally abused.<br /><br />The nice part is that there is plenty of fiber and omega 3's in this snack, so your blood sugar levels won't spike. The fiber in this also leaves you feeling full. But hey, being full never stopped someone from binging on a yummy carbalicious snack every now and then--especially when you haven't consumed many carbs in a while--so approach with caution... and your measuring cups!\n",

Smart lab found out that she could still get out going under the chain link right between two support poles, at the base of the fencing.  Enter the Fido Shocker.  We used an outside porch light which had two bulbs.  Removed one bulb and installed a piece from the hardware store that looked like the threaded end of a light bulb, but was an electical outlet.  This is where we plugged the charger in.  We ran the wire around the base of the fencing, inside the yard.  When the back porch light was on, the fence was hot.  The dog touched it with her nose twice.  It made her yelp.  Then she decided it was easier to just remain in the yard.  Well worth the money.  Easy to set up in a short amount of time.  My husband touched it to see how strong it was.  He warned me not to touch it, becuase he felt is was strong enough it might bring tears to my eyes, so I never touched it.  When we moved, we took it all down, put it in the box and I still have it, but have not needed to use it since then.  It works!!\n",

      "When I opened the Weruva can (3oz, chicken), I immediately noticed that there is not enough solid food (chicken) in the can, and a large amount of the volume is filled up by potato starch and water (85% moisture).  I looked at the label - it says: \"feed adult cats 1 oz for each pound of body weight\".  So, it means that I need to give my 14 pounds cat 4 cans a day to maintain his present weight.  Usually when other pet food company says that, they are exaggerating and your pet can live on half the amount they recommended.  But it is not the case for Weruva, based on their website, the calorie content for the 5.5 ounce can is only 84 cal.  So, by doing a simple math, the calorie content for the 3oz can is only ~46 cal.  The ideal calorie intake for my 14 pounds cat is 195cal (formula: ideal weight (13 pounds) multiply by 15).  In other words, I need to feed my cat four 3oz can per day.  So, I need to spend $4 (3oz) per day on cat food (he lives on a non-kibble diet).  That is a lot of dough!!! And I can do better by making my own cat food or switch to another non-grain cat food brand.  I think this product is overpriced and cat owners need to be aware of the calorie content in Weruva's canned cat food, so that they won't underfeed their pets with insufficient amount of calorie.\n",

I especially love the whole sweetened almost dessert essence of the new-age coffee house delicacies thanks in large part to the booming business of Starbucks and obviously trickling down into so many `other' cafes, like Maui Wowi (which I recently discovered thanks to a quick trip to H.E.B.).  So, I am far from opposed to downing one of these canned coffee drinks because, above all else, they are `coffee drinks', not coffee and when one actually pops the top and tips it back, that is what they should be expecting.  If you take a sip expecting an actual cappuccino then you are setting yourself up for disappointment.  But, if you look at this `illy' drink as yet another in the vein of the Starbucks bottled drinks then you are sure to be happy with the result.  It is sweet with the right hint of coffee flavor.<br /><br />Sadly, I don't really get cappuccino at all (they could have developed that distinct flavor a little more) but at the end of the day it is pretty tasty and has none of the aftertaste of artificial sweetener that can rear its head in drinks like this.<br /><br />Some balk at the price, but $2 a can really isn't that surprising.  I mean, it's the perfect dose and it isn't any more expensive than brand name products in the same wheelhouse.  I may not reach for this every time I need a coffee, but I'm not opposed to throwing one back from time to time.\n",

      "Though not a picky eater at all, I am fairly choosy when it comes to my cereal. I like low calories and sugar, high protein and fiber, and a great taste. For a sweetened cereal (great for a dessert at night) 11g of sugar isn't too high. It's not fabulous, but not horrible either. There are 120 calories in a serving...again, not bad, but the serving size is only 3/4 of a cup, rather than the 1 cup most cereals measure by. Protein and fiber are almost non-existent. The taste, however, is fantastic!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the cereal in moderation or for a dessert rather than the main source of breakfast. It probably won't keep you or the kids full for very long because of the lack of protein and fiber.<br /><br />If you're looking for a suggestion of a delicious cereal that's also good for you, I would try the Kashi GoLean Crisp in Toasted Berry Crumble. 9grams of protein, 8grams of fiber, and 10grams of sugar per serving. And very yummy! Amazon sells that by the 4pack as well.\n",

After trying a French roast K-cup in my brand new coffee brewer and being very disappointed, I decided to give this one a go. Brewing a cup with 5 ounces of water makes a very nice medium strength, vanilla flavored coffee that tastes pretty good in the morning.<br />Usually when I have vanilla coffee, I grind an inch or two of a vanilla bean that's leftover from cooking into dark roasted beans and brew coffee in a regular drip brewer. Compared to that, this coffee is a lighter roast but with a nice flavor, and the vanilla flavor is mildly sweet. This is a coffee k-cup I would serve without hesitation to my dad and I think my husband will love it.<br />Definitely planning to try more of Van Houtte's flavors.\n",

      "Back Story: I adopted a border collie from the pound and kept her on the same dog food she was getting there, which was IAMS Puppy. She had terribly smelly and often very loose stool, including occasional diarrhea which made both of us miserable. She started wanting to go outside to eat grass, so I knew something was wrong in her tummy.<br /><br />I decided to switch dog foods and started doing some research. Looking over ingredients, figuring out the price per day of food for different brands, etc...<br /><br />I found that as far as ingredients, the food appears to be very high quality. More meat, less filler, more quality ingredients. As far as pricing, this food came out to about $1.02 per day, whereas IAMS was only about $0.50 per day. Definitely a big price difference, but hopefully it will prove worth it for my puppy's health. I also looked at Innova puppy which looked comparable and came out to about $0.96 per day.<br /><br />1 DAY: I brought the bag home and even before opening it she showed marked interest in it's contents. I opened up the bag and she started chewing on the cut away strip of bag; it was obvious she loved the taste.<br /><br />**Big point in this 30 pound bag's favor, it is resealable.<br /><br />I mixed a handful into her IAMS and she was much more eager to dig in. For now, this looks promising, though costly. Resealable bag, quality ingredients, puppy likes the taste, twice the cost of IAMS.<br />Based on day 1: 3/5 stars.<br /><br />1 WEEK: She has now worked her way to all Wellness; she hasn't had any diarrhea and her stool and smell seem to have improved. The resealable bag still seals. Based on the apparent improvement in her bowel functions I would rate wellness 4/5 stars.<br /><br />Hopefully there will be even more improvement after she has been on Wellness for a month and away from whatever was making her ill in Iams. I am guessing it may have been a food allergy.<br /><br />1 MONTH: Diarrhea recurred several times, so it didn't turn out to be a miracle cure food. Bag still reseals. Stool/gas smells worlds better than before.<br /><br />What it boils down to is:<br /><br />+Higher Quality Ingredients than most brands<br />+Resealable Bag<br />+Significant Reduction in smell of stool/gas from Iams<br />-Twice the cost of Iams<br /><br />Final Rating<br />4/5<br /><br />Update: I've worked my way through the bag now and I also narrowed down what was causing her loose stool/diarrhea after a particularly bad day. She would refuse to drink water until I offered her my bottled water; she is now on purified water and wellness dog food and her stool has firmed up, not a single day of irregularity since.<br /><br />Oh, and the resealable seal still seals; down to the last kibble.\n",

We had to find a dog food that would keep meat on their bones, be good for their bowels and something they liked.<br /><br />We have tried the store brands and regular Purina...a bunch of junk that is....  They couldn't keep on weight, their bowel movements were a mess... what else could you expect....<br /><br />We tried the super expensive kind made with great ingredients and it's suppose to make them fuller so they eat less and poop less due to absorbing most of the good nutrients and be better al round.....  Well that didn't work.  Our Dogs dropped so much weight,  you could see their ribs start to be bony...their poop was firmer but we had to feed them way more than recommended...which made the cost go higher  (the price is supposed to average out because your supposed to feed them less.....)  Still, even with more feedings they didn't gain weight....<br /><br />Then our little dog started to boy cote eating because she decided she didn't like it.  She seriously wouldn't eat but a few bites.  We had the vet check them all out, no worms or anything they weren't sick we just had to keep looking for the right food and in the mean time try putting eggs on it or mix in leftovers.  We did that and she would push around the dog food and eat the other stuff...so pick she was!<br /><br />It wasn't until we dog sat another dog who ate Beneful Healthy weight, then she started to eat!  She loved it and would eat his food.  So we went out and bought The Original Beneful and all the Dogs loved it, they ate it up.  They eat once a day and are satisfied, their bowels are firm and they quickly gained their weight back.  We did mix in a bag of  puppy beneful to help with quick weight gain but then after that first bad we just used the original.  We would use a bag of the puppy food during growth spurts and the end of fall to help maintain a healthy weight.<br /><br />We love it and can't say enough good things about it and the cost is sufficient...more than others but less than those high dollar ones.  I know what the others say about the first ingredients and what not...but I know what works for our dogs and this is it!\n",

      "In the category it's in, I rate this 5 stars.  Sure, there are higher quality cocoas and chocolates out there, but for the price, and the ease of use, this rates high in my 'recipe' book.  This does have a bit more sweetness than what I would normally drink, but adding semi-sweet chocolate chips to the cup cuts down on that aspect.<br /><br />I use the Back to Basic Hot Cocoa/Latte maker and it does a wonderful job of mixing all lumps out (of any brand) and heating my hot chocolate or hot cocoa fast and thoroughly.  The difference is that hot chocolate is made by melting chocolate bars or morsels, it has a higher cocoa butter content than your cocoas.  I sometimes use a mix of both cocoa powder and a handful of chocolate, makes for a decadent hot drink.  I also use a splash of heavy cream with whole milk to make my hot cocoa, it makes it extra rich and creamy.  Don't forget to add a few drops of real vanilla extract to add a sublime nuance to your cocoa and chocolate drinks.  I also enjoy mixing a few brands of cocoa powders and chocolate bars to make outrageous hot cocoa/hot chocolate drinks.  I haven't tried the frozen hot chocolate by a famous restaurant (S3) yet, but this brand, along with others I purchased on Amazon will all be thrown into the mix :)<br /><br />This mixes smoothly, is slightly sweeter than others I use, has a perfect color, and the powder is very finely milled making it excellent for sprinkling on top of cappuccino or whipped cream.  Not bitter, just a good chocolate taste that comes through.  Can't beat it for the connoisseur hot cocoa drinker to add to their arsenal.\n",

      "I had high hopes for this gluten-free bread mix, and although it had many good qualities, I probably wouldn't buy it again because I didn't care for the flavor. I made it in my breadmaker and it rose nicely and held its shape reasonably well after I took it out of the machine. I let the bread cool before I cut it as all gluten free bread can fall if cut while hot, and the bread sliced very well. Each individual slice had a spongy, soft bread texture. Actually it was almost a little TOO soft for me, but those who like soft bread might enjoy it. I cut a slice and put margarine and honey on it, expecting to have a tasty bite of fresh bread- but something about the flavor bothered me, and I had difficulty enjoying it. I have had almost every kind of gluten-free bread on the market and have been gluten free for a long time, but I don't know how I feel about this new Sorghum craze. Although it yields decent nutritional value and good texture, similarly to bean flour, if there is too high of a ratio of sorghum to neutral flours (White rice, tapioca, etc.) I think that the flavor is negatively impacted. I prefer a more subtle mix, like Bette Hagman's four flour blend, which has less sorghum and thus gets the good qualities of the flour without negatively impacting flavor. I toasted the bread for sandwiches for a few days and my husband ate it without complaint (he is not gluten-free), but because I didn't like the bread and it reminded me a little of playdough, I don't think I'll buy it again. My entirely subjective opinion aside, if you are looking for an easy gluten-free bread mix for your machine, I would recommend that you try this mix, because only trial and error will help you find a bread mix that suits your palate. I prefer homemade bean flour blends, Bob's red Mill GF bread, or The gluten free Pantry's favorite sandwich bread, but you may find this mix fits the bill perfectly!<br /><br />One other note- Most of the 99 reviews listed for this item are actually NOT for this specific mix- they are for the full spectrum of Pamela's products on Amazon. So, while people like this mix- 99+ people have not (yet) rated this item.\n",

      "First off, I love the taste and texture of the ultimate product of this mix.  I also appreciated the novelty of the bag concept and had no problems with the instructions.  That being said, I'm going to stick with a blender and liquid mix for most situations.  The bag concept would be great for picnics (beach or no) provided you had exactly six hours to leave it in the freezer before you left.  Otherwise the stuff is a huge pain to get out of the bag in a fashion even vaguely resembling an actual margarita.  Left in the freezer longer than the allotted time and and the stuff freezes into a pretty solid block.  I also thought the proportions listed on the bag to be a little off, my personal preference has you adding a little more tequila and the triplesec is definitely a required component (not optional, as the bag puts it).<br /><br />It's a product worth trying once, in any event.\n",

But instead of cleaning his plate like he does with Newman's, half the can of food was left untouched. So I'm now subscribing to Newman's because I think it's a great deal for organic cat food (which Wellness is not) even if it has grains.

So the new tea is indeed a completely different product (these changes span all packaging types: single boxes, bags, 100 count, and 6-box count).<br /><br />Their customer service however, is SUPERB. They offered to replace the 6 boxes with any of their other products. I chose loose-leaf Decaf Earl Grey (which is almost as delicious as the pre-change Earl Grey).

      "I have actually tried all three new Taco Bell Sauces, the Jalape&ntilde;o which I am reviewing now, and also the Spicy Ranchero and the Chipotle sauces.<br /><br />Of the three, the Jalapeno is my least favorite because it has the flavor that seems to miss the mark.  It's got a little spice in a creamy base but it just doesn't seem to mesh together well.  Maybe because it's refridgerated and if it's going to be creamy and spicy I'd prefer to have it warm.  It just does not seem to work well and I can't figure out what food this sauce would taste best with.  The label says to use it on Taco Salads and tacos and things like that.  And you could use it on fries.... but I am not sure that it would taste all that great considering there are so many other options.  I would urge you to try one of the other two new Taco Bell sauce flavors first, the Spicy Ranchero or the Chipotle.  Both of those were much better in my opinion.<br /><br />The bottles are squeeze bottles but I found that they don't squeeze out easily once you are half way done with the bottle. You have to store upside down in the fridge or be forced to really shake the bottle to get the sauce to be forced down the the top. Sauces are thicker than traditional salad dressings.\n",

The noodle are very, very, very thin. Thinner than I would like.<br />Also, the packaging, in a bag, does not provide adequate protection and a great deal of the noodle were broken to tiny, tiny pieces. Ok, for a soup I guess, but in say, a stir fry, no.<br />I looked at other brands in the store today and they all used a much stronger package to protect the very delicate noodles.<br />So not at all sure I would buy these again.\n",

      "Our older dog, Broccoli, has been quietly aging.  Sleeping on the couch instead of the bed, not jumping up, rarely playing...it all started so gradually we didn't really notice until he was virtually sleeping all day.  His hips were so stiff when he walked, his gate stilted and he never ran anymore.<br /><br />A friend and I were talking about his decreased mobility a few weeks ago and she recommended we try glucosamine and chondroitin, so we purchased Zuke's Hip Action (beef.)  After two weeks of feeding him a double dose, we've noticed a HUGE change.  While some stiffness in his hips is still evident, he's been running around, jumping on the bed, jumping up on his back legs and playing much more often and for longer periods of time.  Where he would once play for a few seconds and then lie down, he's now begging to play and run around.  I can't wait to see his progress in a month.  We plan to reduce the amount to the one treat a day (recommended for his size) after 6 weeks, per recommendations I've read online.  We're also giving a treat to our new puppy every day to ward off any future problems and keep his joints healthy (he's a greyhound mix with really long legs, so we're concerned about the various bone/joint problems that he could be prone to.)<br /><br />As far as taste, both dogs LOVE these treats, more than any other we've tried in fact.  We'll be giving Zuke's as a daily supplement from now on, as we're firm believers in the benefits of them.  I'm so glad to see my old friend acting like a puppy again.  Thank you Zuke's!\n",

      "I wish I'd known the ingredient list for Hershey's Cinnamon Chips when I bought these (the ingredient list was not part of the product description as the time of this review).  There's no real cinnamon in them.  I had been using King Arthur's mini cinnamon chips previously (ingredients: sugar, palm oil, cinnamon, nonfat dry milk, soy lecithin) and was happy with them, but I was curious about Hershey's chips.  They were cheaper than King Arthur's, and I'd heard people rave about the Hershey's cinnamon chips.<br /><br />Well, curiosity killed the cat.  Now I have a lot of bags of Hershey's cinnamon chips that I don't want to use in my baked goods.....  I might end up using them if I'm baking something to give away where the person eating it won't know I made it.  I used my King Arthur chips in Cinnamon Chip Bread, great results, but when I switched to Hershey's, the chips kinda melt and get mixed a little with the bread dough, and that turned my bread YELLOW.  Artificial colors are on the ingredient list before the natural & artificial flavor.... that's a lot of  artificial color!  I usually don't care about artificial ingredients, I'm a junk food addict who drools at the sight of bright orange Doritos, but the yellow bread the Hershey's cinnamon chips made was displeasing.  Not to mention the flavor of the bread, which was negatively affected by the Hershey's chips.  Didn't have that same sweet cinnamon flavor that the King Arthur chips give.<br /><br />Why'd I give this product 3 stars instead of 1 star?  My husband didn't care about the changes in the bread, he'll eat anything I turn my nose up at, so he'll probably end up eating stuff I make for him with the Hershey's cinnamon chips.  Hopefully my bags of chips won't go to waste, but I won't buy Hershey's cinnamon chips again.<br /><br />Ingredient list for Hershey's Cinnamon Chips:<br />Sugar; nonfat milk; partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (palm kernel and soybean oil); palm kernel oil; contains 2% or less of: cornstarch; artificial colors (Yellow 6 Lake; Yellow 5 Lake; Blue 2 Lake); natural and artificial flavor; salt; palm oil; soy lecithin.\n",

The red box (Cay Cicegi) is presented as better and stronger than Filiz, and the black box (Altinbas) is best among these four tea types. However, the prices on Amazon.com are at least double of what you can find at your local ethnic food stores. See if you can find any local stores if possible. Once you find a local merchant, you will find more choices to buy with tea, like Turkish delight, baklava, halva, Turkish cookies, white (feta) cheese, black/green olives, sudjook, and much more.

I immediately saw that the amount they ate of this food was much more than their usual grain-free food, they seemed to be starving and feeding all the time. They also became less energized than usual, my cats are Siamese and are constantly running after each other and very active with their toys. They became lethargic and were not as interested in their usual activities. I called my vet and she suggested catnip and not to worry, hmm, never needed catnip before...<br /><br />Well I did worry, and did my research. Online I found that Science Diet's pride and joy is their belief in using corn and other grains, you also need a chemistry major in order to fully understand their ingredient list. Last time I checked my cats were obligate carnivores and was distressed that such a food was suggested, no less by my vet. Further research I found that the reason Science Diet is so recommended by vets is because Science Diet spends quite a bit of money in the major vet schools in the nation. They also give an incredible amount of money and support to many animal hospitals and shelters, for that I commend them much! I will give credit when credit is due, I think is wonderful that they give so much charity. With that said this food is nothing more than kibble, I can see why my cats were so hungry all the time, this food did not provide the energy they required. Going back to grain-fee, the first ingredients in this product are rice and corn.<br /><br />Also the fact that this food is so expensive when is no different that the kibble in supermarket stores is ludicrous!\n",

Maybe the initial strength deadens the taste buds temporarily. One upside is that it isn't nearly as sticky or soft as other gums, so it doesn't make a mess trying to throw it away.  Make sure you keep it away from pets, because Xylitol is toxic for dogs.\n",

It is perfect for her as she is 13yrs and 6 months and has lost many of her teeth.  The bits are small and easy for older dogs who have few teeth which makes it hard for her to chew anything that is tough or hard. After giving her her morning treat she sat on her mat and waited for some more - actually begging for more. I will be ordering more of these Fish bits as they fit my pet's requirements.

She was fine with some for awhile, but then got tired of them, Blue Buffalo being one example.  Others she just turned her nose up at right from the start--surprisingly including Taste of the Wild, which most dogs seem to be crazy about.  But the Wellness CORE original recipe has been something she's liked consistently for a long time now.<br /><br />She's never had any allergy issues with this product, her eyes and coat look great, she has tons of energy and, thank heavens, no gas.  In the fall and winter she eats windfall apples and the stench is beyond belief, so I'm grateful that the rest of the year the Wellness CORE keeps her gas-free!<br /><br />If you're looking for a high-quality, grain-free dry food for your dog, give Wellness CORE a try.\n",

I have one cat that suffers from IBS. She has to take prednisone daily, so I'm hoping the change in food will improve her condition.  Though Newman's products are expensive, I believe the organic ingredients will make a big difference in my cats' overall health, which in turn will mean fewer trips to the vet and more money in my pocket.  Besides that, I love the fact that there is strict quality control and oversight in everything that goes into a can or a bag, and all the proceeds from the sale of Newman's Own pet food are donated back to animal shelters and the SPCA.

Whereas other vanilla coffees have the vanilla ending in the scent, this coffee has a nice mild taste that does actually hint of vanilla.  It is not a vanilla taste that overpowers the taste of the coffee like a sugary creamer, it is authentic and subtle.  The coffee even has a smooth mouthfeel that brings hints of creme soda.

In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.\n",

Yes they really are that good.<br /><br />I'm not in thrall of the whole \"organic\" thing generally, but I have to say these blue corn chips themselves are somehow FAR better than competitors. Crisp and thick cut, a strong corn taste. You probably don't think a chip can have a strong corn taste, but these do, because unlike competitors they're not cooked in a month old batch of mystery oil.<br /><br />The person who came up with this \"red hot\" flavoring is a genius, this is the best flavoring for chips ever invented.  It will make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head.  It is only a little hot, but it builds up a bit if you eat the whole darn bag, which you almost certainly will.<br /><br />I also recommend their plain blue corn chips for dips, but for the love of everything that is good don't get the unsalted ones.\n",

      "I am always looking for healthy, low calorie snacks, so when I heard about Popchips, I was intrigued.  They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.  This would be a great addition to a sandwich for lunch, or an in-between meal snack.  I am happy to add Popchips to my snack rotation.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "I often wonder if I am the only person in the world who cannot stand microwave popcorn.  Give me real corn and a little oil and I am pretty happy.  Then I discovered this popcorn at a kitchen store in my local outlet.  Then they went out of business and I lost my awesome popcorn connection... until now.<br /><br />Wabash Valley Farms is the best popcorn you can get outside of your local multi-plex (though I really like target popcorn too).  You don't need the whirly popper as indicated on the package instructions - I always cook it on the stovetop in a large covered pot; my sister cooks it in one of those fancy carnival poppers.<br /><br />Each pack contains 5 pouches of product. Each pouch contains popping oil, popcorn, and a buttery salt topping (which I only use about half of - it is very fine and very salty). For those that like additional butter, you can add it after popping.  While I cannot attest to the exact amount of popcorn yielded, it does do a good job of filling up my 32-cup Tupperware Thatsa bowl.  Thatsalotta popcorn.<br /><br />The unit cost is $1.66 per pouch, which may seem high when comparing it to microwave popping corn, but you just cannot compare the quality and taste (and when compared to theater popcorn, it is a fraction of the cost). Orville Redenbacher has nothing on Wabash!\n",

I like other Green Mountain Coffees, especially their darker blends.

      "------------------\n",
      "I really like bold full flavored coffee without bitterness or too much acidity.  I wouldn't call myself a coffee aficionado but I do know what I like.  I own two French presses, an Aeropress, several drip machines, and a moka pot.  All are great but I love the ease of using my Keurig. After purchasing it last year I have probably tried 20 or 25 different k-cups.  For a while I really liked the Donut Shop by Coffee People.  But I grew tired of it.  It's great when it's hot but not so much when it cools off a bit.  Some of the other full bodied cups tend to be very bitter.  The Black Tiger, Jet Fuel, Wake Up Call, Newman's Extra Bold, etc. all can be good but not great.  I had pretty much decided that given the convenience of the Keurig machine I would have to sacrifice a bit on taste.  Then I stumbled on Diedrich's Sumatra and I'm hooked.  This is the one you want to buy in bulk and keep in the pantry.  It's a very good Sumatra blend that is great hot or even just slightly warm.  It's never bitter and very smooth.  It has that classic chocolate Sumatra flavor.  For me this is the only k-cup I've found to be consistent time after time.  I'm on my fourth box already.\n",

While I'm not typically a big consumer of \"natural\" foods (nothing against them, I just don't go out of my way to sneak them out), I try to stay away from obviously unhealthy foods and thought it couldn't hurt to try these as a substitute for less-healthy snacks like chips.  My expectations weren't very high, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that these chips are really pretty tasty.  They're salty and crunchy yet not greasy.  I'm not saying I wouldn't prefer regular old potato chips all else equal, but if you're looking for a healthy alternative and debating giving these a try, I say go for it (because we all know \"all else\" isn't really equal...).\n",

      "Do a taste test. Wet your finger and dip it in some standard table salt. Then repeat with the Himalayan Sea Salt. Notice the difference? We sure did. The Himalayan Sea Salt is not as harsh or bitting, and has a sweeter (yes sweeter) aftertaste. A little less than two years ago I started trying different artesian salts. So far, the Himalayan Salt has been my favorite. It has a mellower flavor, though it is still just as salty. There are also the studies that show it is better for you than your over processed and recently made table salt. I am not sure about that, but I know I like it. If it has trace minerals and no pollutants, so much the better. The grinder is plastic but it has held up well and can be refilled. I'm not sure of the benefit of grinding (unless you like the ritual) so if you just want quick and easy, you may want to consider the [[ASIN:B000SAOKIU  Fine Grain Shaker)]] version.<br /><br />It costs a little more, but I think it is worth it.

      "I have loved Yogi Cocoa Spice for years. I noticed the name on this item was different (it's \"Mayan\"!), and we're calling it a \"supplement\". But I took a chance on 6 boxes, to save time tracking down the old Cocoa Spice. I hoped for the best.<br /><br />The flavor is different, and if I still had an old box I would probably find the formulations are different. This is pretty good for a cocoa tea, to drink instead of eating chocolate,  But it isn't as rich as the original tea. The flavors don't blend together as well, or something. Maybe more focus on marketing and less expensive ingredients?<br /><br />It's not bad, and it is in the same ballpark as the original tea. But I won't be drinking it as frequently. I don't want to have to add coconut milk calories to make it taste as good as the original. YMMV.<br /><br />Now I am worried about all the Yogi teas I like..they have all gotten new names and are \"supplements\". I will be trying them out before I buy any flavor that has had a makeover.\n",

      "This is a non-refrigerated, microwaveable meal containing pasta and tomato sauce. The packaging states that it is \"All Natural\" and contains \"No Preservatives.\" How Barilla is able to give us tomato sauce in liquid form but without any chemicals to keep it palatable is a mystery to me. The plasticized tray packaging is sealed tightly with a stout film cover, so I guess that's the key.<br /><br />The primary ingredient is Mezze Penne pasta which is made with Semolina wheat and Durum flour. The one portion will give you 6 grams of fiber (24% of a 2000-calorie diet). For those of us who have reached the stage of life where fiber intake is critical, this is a wonderful bonus.<br /><br />This is the second one of these Barilla meals that I've tried. I liked the first, but found the Penne a little too tough for my taste, so this time I followed Barilla's instructions \"for softer pasta,\" and after cooking, added a teaspoon of water and cooked for another 30 seconds. This helped but, unfortunately, I still found the pasta just a little rubbery. I have an 1100-watt microwave, and found the 1-minute cooking time plus the additional 30 seconds fine.<br /><br />The rest of the ingredient list yields nothing suspicious other than \"Natural Flavors,\" and \"Tapioca Starch.\"<br /><br />The Tomato sauce is packaged in a separate \"Sauce Tray\" which fits in the main packaging and is microwaved with it. When heating is complete, you remove the sauce tray and pour it over the pasta. That works fine. Prior to heating, you peel back the film covering over the sauce to vent the package. I had no difficulties with any of this. Just be careful to read the instructions before you do anything.<br /><br />The package will give you 320 calories with 5g of fat and 700mg of sodium. The sodium is high (29%) as it is in virtually all pre-packaged meals. It seems the manufacturers have learned how to control all the nutrients--calories, fat, cholesterol, carbs, everything--except salt.<br /><br />I don't think I'd go out of my way to eat this, but for what it is--an ultrasimple, convenient, quick meal that you could stick in your briefcase or backpack on the way out to work or school--it was pretty good. The Arrabbiata sauce was quite tasty. If you don't have access to a cafeteria and don't want something from the deli or the take-out or fast-food places, this is definitely a good alternative.<br /><br />I just need to say a word about price: I never base my ratings on price, because that can change with time and retailer and sales, but DO NOT pay 40 bucks for 6 of these shipped. That's just plain nuts. At two or three dollars apiece, they make sense. At six plus, they don't.\n",

That $5 bag of slop comes with a much higher price.  Many of the big brand cat food producers use ingredients of poor quality and aren't easily digestible.  Many of these same companies test their food on cats kept locked up in small cages 24x7.

I now cook him up some chicken hearts and conceal the pills inside every day as needed while he isn't looking, then trim them down to barely cover the pill. I get him excited by quickly feeding him the trimmings, followed up by the main piece with the pill inside. On occasion he still finds them, but he likes chicken so much that it works quite well, so far, anyway.<br /><br />Obviously Pill Pockets work very good for most people, but not for me and my dog.\n",

      "First and foremost, having enjoyed the 'Blonde' variety of Starbucks since it's conception, it's pointless for me to tell you that I buy this product religiously and think it to be the best coffee on the market today.  What I can tell you is about the packaging for the 54-count package and my experience with K-Cups, in general.<br /><br />If you opt to go with the higher count package, please note that it does *not* come in retail box packaging.  Sure, the K-Cups are the same but, you get a brown box versus several 'retail' packages.  This, to me, isn't a big deal in the least.  It's not a large box and I'd rather recycle one box than several smaller ones.  My point - if this is an issue to you, buy in a different quantity.  Secondly, the K-Cup patent is a great one but, unfortunately for Keurig, it's days are numbered.  While I've tried to grind my own beans and use a ECOBREW reusable K-Cup filter to get the same results as the Veranda Blend K-Cup, I've been unsuccessful in getting it 'how I want it'.  As such, I've continued to pay a higher price per cup of coffee but, in the end, I still think it to be worth it -- it's a very unique blend.  What I can assure you is that the prices per cup will likely fall off upon the expiration of the K-Cup patent.  For that, I'll keep my wallet handy for these until they hopefully fall off in price due to competition in the near future.<br /><br />A+ service by Amazon, as usual, with PRIME!\n",

This rice has a great smell while it's cooking, I put it in my Zojirushi cooker and it didn't take all that long to have perfect rice.<br /><br />I use this rice in a variety of ways, even putting honey in it and using it as a breakfast cereal. My palate is undoubtedly weird, but I don't care, my diet has saved my life.<br /><br />As I will be eating this rice nearly every day, I'm very pleased with the price and thrilled with the flavor and texture.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY\">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.\n",

      "I'm a working mother who was suffering from a steadily decreasing milk supply after returning to work.  Despite pumping every three hours at work (for a total of 3 pumping sessions per day), I was starting to have to top off my baby's bottles with frozen milk from my freezer stash.  At first it was an extra ounce a day, then two, then three.  As any breastfeeding mother knows, that's a dangerous road to go down because it can lead to even more supply issues in the future.<br /><br />I decided to try supplementing with fenugreek, but because I am naturally very suspicious of supplements and worried about side effects, I did a ton of research on the pros/cons of fenugreek before starting supplementation.  My research suggests that fenugreek can have an effect on blood sugar levels, so people with blood sugar issues should consult a doctor before trying the supplement.  I've learned to minimize the blood sugar effects for myself by always taking my fenugreek right after eating my main meals.  This way, the blood sugar effects are more than offset by the food in my system.<br /><br />The biggest mistake people make when trying fenugreek to increase milk supply is to not take enough of the herb.  It is critical to take enough, or you will not see any effect.  Some women can see an effect by taking 2 610mg pills three times a day (for a total of 6 pills a day).  Personally, I had to increase my dosage to 3 610mg pills three times a day (for a total of 9 pills a day) to get the desired effect.  Also, you have to be very consistent and really work hard not to skip any doses.  After a couple days of starting supplementation, I saw an increase in my supply, so I am now able to pump enough milk for my baby's bottles during the day while I am at work.  Thanks to the fenugreek, I'm getting a 2-3 ounce boost per day, which is not a huge amount, but it's all I needed.  Good luck!\n",

But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.\n",

The sauce is basically ranch dressing mixed with some spices, but isn't all that spicy. Again like the Chipotle sauce, the Spicy Ranchero sauce has a two tablespoon serving that clocks in at 110 calories. For as fatty as these are, you'd think they'd taste better. I'd like to see Taco Bell cut some of the oils out and tweak the spiciness before trying this line again.\n",

      "Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The original flavor reviewed here tastes a lot like Sprite, but Ramune also comes in several other flavors. It uses high fructose corn syrup and/or cane sugar as a sweetener (It lists both on the label, which usually means that it uses whatever is cheapest on the world market at the time of bottling. Listing both also means that they don't have to change their labeling every time they change sweetener.)<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more.<br /><br />Ramune six-packs are easy to find at just about any Asian market at around $7 or $8. If you have to order online, try some of the various Asian food sites out there as the price here is just too high to justify unless you have absolutely no other option.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.\n",

      "Buyer Beware - Potential Choking Hazard\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "I believe that people need to be aware of the fact that the kibble size of the Adult Oral Care Dry Cat Food is VERY large and presents a potential choking hazard to their pets.  I transitioned my cat to this food from the Science Diet kitten formula when he was about 15 months old.  From day one, I thought that the kibble size was abnormally large for cat food.  I've had cats for over twenty years, and have used many different cat food formulas.  Never have I seen one with kibble this large.  It is close to marble sized.  It was so large that my cat would take one piece out of his bowl at a time to eat it.<br /><br />Even though I was concerned, I was naive enough to think that Hill's would not manufacture a food that could in any way harm a person's pet as Science Diet is highly recommended by many vets.  I was terribly wrong.  About a month after transitioning to this formula, I watched in horror as my beautiful little oriental shorthair stood choking after a piece of kibble got stuck in his mouth.  For anyone who has ever witnessed this, it is a horrible sight.  The poor little cat will pant and paw at the side of their face - as if they want to reach their paw into their mouth, but can't.  I was extremely fortunate - as my boy was finally able to expel the piece of kibble from his mouth, which of course came out whole. I immediately threw the remainder of the food in the trash can.  As painful as it was to watch, I considered it a warning.  Had I not been home to witness the scene, it could have easily happened again with far more dire consequences.<br /><br />I subsequently wrote to Hill's about my concern that this food presented a choking risk and received the most ridiculous and uncaring response that you can possibly imagine.  First they felt compelled to tell me that this particular formula was designed to maintain oral care and that they had a different formula for adult cats.  This was completely insulting as I was very much aware of that fact and had intentionally purchased the food for the stated oral care benefits.  In addition, the fact that they have other formulas has nothing to do with the concern I have with this particular formula.  Next they asked if I \"transitioned\" my cat to the new food, in what I can only interpret as a lame attempt at trying to make me feel as if I was somehow responsible for the situation.  Short of putting the food into a blender, there would be no other appropriate way of \"transitioning\" one's pet to avoid the risk of choking on this product.<br /><br />I don't for one minute believe that my cat's experience was an isolated occurence.  If you are thinking about buying this product, please, please, please be aware of the risk as it is VERY real.\n",

They fill up on less food. Their stools are small and firm. Most importantly they have never been to the vet except for shots ! Even if it costs a little more it saves you money in the long run !<br />You really do get what you pay for in dog food. Organic, as possible, is the way to go.<br />Now that my little girl is getting older and not running around as much I have incorporated some Innova Low Fat into their mix and that hasn't bothered either of them at all ! The kibble is a little bigger ( maybe twice ) but that is still very small and easy for small dogs to eat.<br />I have to be creative because these two are going to eat only what the other does ! So I not only have to please a 4 & 10 year old but make a diet that is healthy for both !<br />Innova makes that easier than most products on the market !\n",

I used too much and wasn't pleased with the flavor results.<br /><br />What I've learned since:  Use a dropper to measure the amount of flavoring!  Use orange oil with only SIX DROPS PER LITRE. It was my error in the beginning that made the products seem bad.  Root Beer in particular is very bitter if you use too much.<br /><br />I purchased these to use with my Soda Stream soda maker and Sweat Leaf Stevia sweetener.  The vials seem small, but they make quite a bit when you use them sparingly.  I now keep a dropper handy for measuring.<br /><br />I'm simply having a ball choosing what flavor of soda I am drinking for the day.\n",

      "There are three broad categories of herbal tea that I rely on throughout the Fall, Winter, and early Spring:<br /><br />1) Citrus and lemongrass<br />2) Rose hips and hibiscus<br />3) Chamomile<br /><br />For me, Tazo has held first place in each of these categories for the last several years. This is no small feat - I'm cutthroat when it comes to my tea collection! Wild Sweet Orange is by far the best citrus and lemongrass tea I have ever had.<br /><br />For those of you who have never tried it, do not be mislead by the name. It is extremely tart and not at all sweet. I happen to love tart, fruity herbal teas and this recipe is so closely tuned to my tastes I could swear that the good people at Tazo had consulted a sample of my DNA during the design process.<br /><br />I actually never expected to like it, since I don't drink orange-flavored teas as a rule; they're generally too sweet and mellow for my tastes. I ended up with my first cup of Wild Sweet Orange due to a mix-up at the store a few years back and it absolutely blew my mind. The flavor profile is complex and I never get tired of drinking it.<br /><br />If you like tart, fruity, teas then put down that cup of Lemon Zinger and give Wild Sweet Orange a try.\n",

They both sell for roughly the same price, both are natural with no preservatives, so the only factor being judged here is taste. The Don Pepino won favoritism amongst my large family by 100%. The issue with the Pastorelli sauce is that it is overpowering to the point that when you bite into a slice all you taste is the Pastorelli. I'm not sure about everyone else, but my ideal pizza is one where the three parts (crust, sauce, & cheese) compliment each other and create a blended taste of all three. The Don Pepino did just that. At the end of the night all of the Don Pepino slices were gone but there were plenty of Pastorelli slices left.\n",

      "If you're doing a low carb diet or even just want to cut down on them then these are really some of the best low-carb chips you can buy.<br /><br />Taste/Texture: They don't REALLY taste like chips but honestly its close enough to, say, a dorito, that it works. The texture is different, a little lighter than a chip which may be a positive for some people. You definitely get the chili nacho cheese flavor from it and in my opinion it's about the closest you're going to get to a \"real\" chip if you're looking for low carb. Haven't tried the other flavors though.<br /><br />Size: The bags are small, yes, but not that much smaller than a regular small sized bag of chips. You might find yourself eating more than one bag as a snack though.<br /><br />Price: Pretty good when you buy the bulk (12 pack) product although it works out to about a dollar a bag which IS a little pricey I guess but when you look at it as \"12 dollars for a pack of 12\" somehow, to me, it seems like a better deal. Also, if you like them, sign up for the regular deliveries and it shaves 2 dollars off each order AND includes free shipping so you really can't beat that. Considering the high price of a lot of speciality products (and this is) it's pretty inexpensive.<br /><br />Overall: A good purchase for low carb dieters, a tasty chip substitute, something even fans of traditional chips may enjoy.

      "With the Amazon Mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless there's a sale.  It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earth's Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earth's Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you're getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.<br /><br />Earth's Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I've tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While I've seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth's Best, it's much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  I'm going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but I'll probably always keep a few jars of Earth's Best to get by in a pinch.\n",

      "Before I bought this sprouter, I used a jar with a screen lid on it and had failure after failure. I don't know what I was doing wrong, but it seemed like I never could get those alfalfa sprouts to \"sprout maturity\"! Since I got this baby, I am the green queen of sprouting! (at least I feel like it...)I was a little concerned about the plastic stuff, but it seems very stable and does not impart any plastic \"flavor\" to the greens. I am so pumped that I am moving on to other sproutables. It is very easy to use, and I rinse once in the morning and once before I go to bed. That seems to be enough, but you can rinse more often. I have good water (no chlorine or fluoride) and with this tray my sprouts grow, grow, grow!<br /><br />When I'm ready to harvest them, the \"mat\" they form is easy to sort of peel up. I put them in a large salad spinner and fill it with water and sort of loosen them up, freeing the hulls to float on the top. Then I get a small strainer (everyone has one of those, right?) and put it over the kitchen sink drain and pour out the water into the strainer. That's where the hulls go (then into the compost bin) instead of down the drain! Then, I whir the salad spinner and get the sprouts \"dry\" and in they go to a container in the fridge with the lid cracked--so they can \"breathe\" a little bit.<br /><br />I have been doing this since I started growing with this sprouter. I understand you can actually stack these to grow more, but I will have to wait a bit before I become that adventurous.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, one more thing....After you soak the seeds for 6 or more hours (directions come with the sprouter or you can go to their website) and have them in the sprouter, I adjust the lid so it's open about an inch. Gives them room to breathe.<br /><br />Get it! Your body will thank you for growing LIVE food for it! Be good to yourself and discover sprouting---so much CHEAPER than the stores!!\n",

I definitely recommend this bar if you like unsweetened chocolate for snacking, and would definitely recommend this for your baking needs, too.<br /><br />One note about the price, though - it is a pretty good deal to get this for $3.50 a bar.  However, if you can, try to wait for the 12-pack to come into stock so that you can get a better bulk price, and also free shipping, since the shipping for just one bar is kind of steep.\n",

I tried using a food processor at first but it was kind of a pain, so definitely recommend this. My one suggestion is to always reserve the leftover water that collects in the bottom of the steam basket - you'll sometimes need to add some of it to certain foods to help get them smooth when blended.

Preserves have chunk of the fruit in it which with Raspberries should have seeds unless they specify that it is a seedless version.  So to say the least I was really disapointed as I wanted the great preserve taste of black raspberry with the seeds. not a kind of jam/puree version.. That a side the taste is good as far as a black raspberry flavor but the whole reason I bought preserves is I wanted the actual black raspberry with seeds. I even looked thru the choices on Amazon of black Raspberry and discarded the ones that mentioned that it was seedless so it would have been nice if they at least were up front about that,because they list in their profile that number 1 ingrediant is fruit.Ok, so where are the seeds and berries? Anyway if you like seedless or need seedless because of dentures etc.. this is a good tasty choice. But if you want the full taste of black raspberries with seeds in a preserve I suggest looking elsewhere.<br /><br />Update June 1 2012 I suggest these two fine examples of what Black Raspberry Preserves should be Blue Ridge or St. Dalfour black raspberry preserves.\n",

This was very disappointing, as the only places I can find this great product are in the next state over in health food stores and Whole Foods.  The way Amazon keeps this product stored and ships it, ruins the flavor and causes the containers to be damaged.

The reviews were absolutely astonishing, so I figured, what the heck.<br /><br />Wrong, wrong, wrong!<br /><br />Every popchip I tried had a very faint taste and smell of being burnt. Most of the flavors and seasonings are so weak that they don't come close to masking the taste. The end result? They tasted like water with 1/4th as much flavoring added or coke with a tall glass full of melted ice.<br /><br />Worst of all, the taste of burnt potatoes only accumulated as I ate more chips. I could not bear many of these in one sitting, and I hate to waste.<br /><br />There is, however, 1 exception. Barbeque flavor. These had a strong enough flavor to almost completely mask the burnt taste, and actually be quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, there was only 2 of those bags in this box (out of 12), so I still had 10 unbearable bags to consume.<br /><br />I sincerely wish this product was better, but there's clearly something wrong with their manufacturing process.

      "I have a 65lb 3 year old Boxer and an 80 lb 8 month old Cane Corso. They both love this food. Luckily, I live next to a pet food distributor, and it is cheaper there. ($[...] for the 30lb bag) This has been the only food my boxer has been able to keep weight on. We've tried Evo (Which worked but it was too expensive), Innova, Candidae, and solid gold no grain formula. She always looked sickly thin. Most her ribs showed and  some of her spine. We took her to the vet and they found nothing wrong with her. She is just an extremely active dog. We tried switching around foods to see if we could get her to gain weight. After switching to this formula, she looks like a NORMAL dog! You can not see her ribs as easily anymore and can pet her without feeling her spine. I guess she was just too active for the other foods.<br />My Cane does very good on it too. He is the perfect the weight! Although I think it has too much protein for him to be on it for very long.<br />I would recommend this food for people who have VERY active dogs like mine. The ingredients are good too, it is grain free. (My boxer is also allergic to grains) It is worth the extra money to spend on a good quality dog food like this one!\n",

That's what happened here.  Then I went on to the taste:  this stuff is weak with a bitter undertone; and then, oddly, it tastes, as the first sip goes down, as though water was added.  I use the 5 ounce side of my Keurig.  Can only imagine that the large cup would be right up there with dishwater.  I will slug down the remaining 17 kcups, but will never purchase again.\n",

So the result in my tests was some very weak coffee, and more time spent preparing it than the elaborate packaging warrants. This is no easier than just tossing some grounds in a regular coffee maker with a filter, or using a French Press, and either of those methods will result in a good cup of Joe.<br /><br />The flavor of the coffee was good, hence the 3 stars, but the coffee was weak and trying to brew it was a bother.

Light-headed, and just not right. So she stopped drinking the water and felt better.<br /><br />We had high hopes for the water. We tested the pH with pH strips, but it doesn't come out right in the results as Essentia states you need a special machine to test the pH when the pH is so high.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there wasn't much information that Essentia could offer about the health benefits of using water with a high pH. So, we were disappointed.<br /><br />We read elsewhere that using a high pH water could be good in the short term, but not necessarily in the long term.<br /><br />So do your research to see if it's what you want, and then go easy on it when starting to use it and monitor how you do as you might not feel great after using it as was the case with my wife.<br /><br />I tested it.

The cooking time is quite a bit longer than regular oatmeal but if you have the time to devote to the cooking then its well worth it.

      "Best Non-Organic Dog Food\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "Adopting an abused 2 year old Shih Tzu has been an interesting experience for our family over the past few months. We started Aggie out on Trader Joe's kibble, believing this to be an acceptable, more natural product for both our dogs. Aggie could never digest the TJ's product, so I began researching what doggie naturalists were feeding their dogs. And, it looked like the raw meat diet was the way to go and definitely no grains. This went great for about a month untill we got a bad batch of premade raw dog food (super expensive @ $60/week) and had terrible projectile poo and throwup for 3 days each! So, I said, forget this.. not worth it. Next, my research brought me to Acana/Orijen Brand(s). I still feel this is probably the highest quality kibble out there, but after 4 weeks of runny poo on this brand, I realized my little shih tzu just couldn't handle such rich food. My other dog, a chow chow did fine on it but didn't really care for the flavor all that much. The quest for answers continued until I came accross information on Dick Van Patten's web site for his dog food line: Natural Balance. I didn't realize that some dogs can be allergic to meat. For example, chicken is in nearly all dog food, and after a couple of generations (just like soy and wheat with humans), dogs are becoming sensative to chicken as an ingredient. The VERY FIRST DAY I put Aggie on their Duck and Potato Formula (grain free too - I love that!), her poos hardened up and no more bile throw up in the morning. She's been on it now for 10 days, and it has been a wonderful experience - changing all our lives. Though I have to say she doesn't run to the food, but she eats it when she is hungry. Now, our other dog, our Chow Chow begs for it. I've begun mixing the Orijen kibble with the NB canned, and she eats her entire meal right up. I will be transitioning my chow to NB as soon as her remaining Orijen is consumed. Love, Love, Love this product.\n",

Probably my own fault; I should have specified \"No MSG\", except it never occurred to me that a package with this many bad chemicals wouldn't be labelled somewhere!<br />Outside of any of this, the dashi has none of the complexity or subtlety you hope for in a dashi base. I know if I want all of that, I need to make it from scratch, but since purchasing this I've tried several non-MSG brands and all of them are better.

One particularly popular brown rice pasta brand that claims \"NOT MUSHY\" all over the bag is unapalatable unless I cook it like, half the time it's supposed to be. \"Can withstand a lot of overcooking\"? It can't even withstand normal cooking.<br /><br />But this....<br /><br />this golden, delicious, chewy, al-dente, would-thinki-it-was-wheat-felt-like-I-had-to-double-check-the-package-to-make-sure-I-didn't-get-the-wrong-thing pasta?....Amazing. I couldn't believe it and still can't.<br /><br />The texture is EXACTLY like wheat pasta. It has a bite, it has a subtle chewiness. It doesn't taste weird, or have any grittiness. It doesn't get slimey or mushy. It holds its shape, even when I was stirring it up with all sorts of other ingredients and dressing. It's good cold. It's good hot. Holy cow it's just amazing.<br /><br />If this review didn't convince you to go try it, I'm not sure what will. I can mail you a bite of my pasta salad and as you weep with joy you can go get some. :)\n",

My recommendation is to be sure and try all the flavor options before ordering a full case of pods.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "I first saw this salsa in a grocery store in Southern California. The regular price was a bit high, but it was on sale so I picked up a jar. I took it to a friend's where we sat around eating chips and salsa and drinking beer while playing cards. The salsa did not last long. Everyone agreed it was the best jarred salsa they'd ever had. I bought many more jars at the store, on sale and at regular price, and eventually started buying cases direct from the manufacturer.<br /><br />When I moved to Florida I was disappointed that I couldn't find the Arriba! Chipotle salsa in any local stores. Shipping costs made buying direct cost prohibitive. I went a long time without my favorite salsa. I was thrilled when I found it available through Amazon at a reasonable price and eligible for the free super saver shipping.<br /><br />I'm surprised about some of the comments concerning the taste of this salsa. The reviewer who found it truly wretched either got a jar that had gone bad or has a very different sense of taste than most of the rest of us. (There are several very popular food items I absolutely can't stand, so I can relate if it's the latter.) The comment from another reviewer about the salsa having a \"unique\" smell and taste at room temperature is interesting. This is one of the only salsas I've ever had that I actually prefer at room temperature.<br /><br />This salsa has a flavor that's far more complex than most jarred salsas. The fire roasting of the ingredients combined with the wonderful smokiness of the chipotles brings dimensions that few other salsas can match. I still have a couple recipes for home made salsa that I think are better, but this is the best commercially jarred salsa I've ever had.<br /><br />Update -- I have to slightly amend my review. Amazon used to sell this salsa direct at a very attractive price. Unfortunately, it's now available only through a marketplace vendor at a totally ridiculous price. You can order it at the manufacturer's web site for about half what this vendor wants.  It's still fantastic salsa, but at the marketplace price I'd suggest moving along to something else.\n",

      "We haven't found something that is a must have for burgers before.  This is my favorite spice for hamburgers.  It makes them taste better than 99% of the burgers you can buy even at great restaurants. Just use fresh ground beef and the burger rub. It makes burgers taste like what you imagine a perfect burger would taste like.  Its too bad, it seems like it is being dicontinued 'cause we can't find it anywhere but here.  I guess it just didn't catch on.  Yes, it comes out clumpy(when it gets old), but sometimes even the ones from the store come clumpy.  Break the canister open, break it up, and store it in a baggie; its just spices.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "The drink flavor is Kiwi Berry but I tasted a lot of flavors in it besides Kiwi and Berry. There are six fruit juice concentrates included. Note that Kiwi, although listed first on the can label before Berry, is the third fruit listed on the ingredient panel after Apple and Grape. Acerola (Barbados cherry or wild crapemyrtle per Wikipedia), Raspberry and Strawberry are listed as numbers 4, 5 and 6.<br /><br />I tried the beverage cold without ice then with ice.  Even drinking it a little later after it got watered down with the ice it was still a strong flavor and still tasted carbonated.  I noted that there was no aftertaste from Kiwi that I find in other drinks like Hansen.<br /><br />I don't believe the smaller size (8.3 oz.) was created for children, I think it is small to compete with the energy drinks out there that seem to appear in a similar size can.  HOWEVER, there is no caffeine, no added sugar, no guarana, or other \"energy\" added ingredients in this drink so it is safe for children and adults who do not wish to drink stimulant type drinks.  But, another HOWEVER is that this drink is 135 calories just for 8.3 ounces, 34 carbs including 33g of sugar (natural from the fruit juice concentrates).  There is 15mg of sodium and 100% of an adults daily requirement of Vitamin C.<br /><br />I am not sure if I would buy this drink again but it does taste nice.  I would like to try some other flavors from The Switch, however.  This one might make a good base for a punchbowl drink (with ice cream?)<br /><br />I think I should have given this drink fewer stars, now that I think about it.\n",

Sure, you'll see stories of how one person's cat had issues, but even if that's 100% true, it's 1 case out of millions. Science and fact aren't based on someone's experience.<br /><br />So my point is, I love my cats and I'm very concerned about their health. I trust people who actually have medical degrees and experience with a wide range of animals. My only caution is do not fall for some hype or scare tactic that recommends some unproven or untested food or some fad diet for your pet. Don't listen to me, don't listen to the negative review. ASK YOUR VET what they recommend, and follow their instructions. My guess is you'll end up buying the Science Diet anyhow.\n",

It didn't solve all our problems, we still need to add 1.5 oz of pear juice a day for constipation and 1.2 ml of Zantac for heartburn. She still spits up a little too, but it's sooooo much better than before. This stuff is easy to feed since you don't have to mix it yourself. It never cloggs up the nipple. It does stain, most of her clothes and bibs now have light brown stains in it that won't come out. We still like it a lot though and are sticking with it!\n",

So then I gave one to my dog. If he loves something, he will eat it immediately, barely taking time to chew it. If he does not like something he will go bury it and never bother eating it. If it's questionable, he plays with it for a few minutes, then either eats it or buries it. For this treat, he played with it for a few minutes. He did his little puppy dance, bum up in the air, then poking his head at the treat a few times. Totally funny to watch. Then he decided to eat it. So I'd say it's not his favorite, but he decided they aren't bad.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "I love carbonated drinks. Coke, Pepsi, Red Pop, Creme Soda... I think what makes me prefer them is the carbonation. Somehow, it makes me slow down and enjoy the drink more.<br /><br />However, most soft drink companies are just creating different flavors of high fructose corn syrup mixed with the carbonated water. I don't like that. There's nothing good or healthy about HFCS, and I get enough of it in the various foods I purchase without having to drink several ounces of it every day.<br /><br />This product, The Switch, is a great alternative to regular soft drinks. It's basically just carbonated fruit juice with some preservatives added. It gives me that zing I like in carbonated drinks, but without any of the high fructose corn syrup (of course fruit juice has its own sugars). It's much healthier and tastes great.<br /><br />That's what's good about this item. The only bad thing I can think of is that the cans are TINY. I'm sorry; I'm an adult male, and I can't be satisfied with an 8.3 ounce can of juice. Two cans is about right, and at the price they're asking, that's about a dollar and ninety cents to get close to the quantity of a typical bottle of soda pop (20 ounces). Is it worth the upgrade? Yeah, I guess so, but I would think it would make a 24-pack go quickly in my case. I really wish they'd just package them in 16.6 ounce containers, and then still sell as a 24-pack.<br /><br />This flavor, Black Cherry, does not sit with me well. To be fair, I'm not a fan of cherry juice anyway, but when you introduce the carbonation to cherry juice, it ends up tasting more like cough medicine than a tasty beverage. That's just my opinion, of course, and I'm sure fans of cherry juice will love it. Personally, I would like to see just plain Strawberry, and I'd probably like some other berry choices like Mulberry, Blackberry, and Raspberry. Cherry, for me, isn't the ideal choice, which is why my review of Strawberry-Watermelon gets five stars, but this one only gets four stars. Quality-wise, they're both the same; My biggest grip as concerns this review is this specific flavor.<br /><br />All told, I'd have to recommend this product if you want a fizzy drink without the crud you find in most other soft drinks. This is at least real fruit juice, and while I can't say that carbonated drinks of any kind are \"good for you\", I can at least say that this one is made with good intentions and won't make you feel like you're bloated after downing a couple of them. I'm going to \"subscribe\" to one of their products soon, just to see if I can notice a change in my weight, energy level, and general health by switching (Hey!, See? Good product name!) to something that is a bit more natural.<br /><br />As always, your mileage may vary. I'm sure your taste does.\n",

I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind.\n",

I thought these sprinkle/quins will look cute and go together with the pink frosting. What I received wasn't \"Pastel\" color sprinkles/quins, but darker brighter colors. (yellows, reds, blues, oranges, and greens) I thought I was getting \"Pastel\" Confetti Sprinkle/Quins?! They aren't so flat like the pic above. I read the Legal Disclaimer, but I was still disappointed! In the long run I did end up using them, because I needed them for an emergency order.

      "I was a HUGE fan and recommended it highly.  However, I just tossed a whole box.  Something has changed -- and not in a good way.  I had concerns last year and thought maybe the taste was \"off\" just on the one box.  So I picked up another box last week.  It's even WORSE!  Since General Mills bought LaraBars (Humm Foods) three years ago, the product just seems to have gone down hill.  It doesn't have the same fresh, alive taste; there is a harsh, metallic flavor that indicates whatever machinery produces the bar now is not being properly cleaned.  Also the bar didn't used to be so oily to the touch.  Oily, weird flavors in nut bars make me think the nuts have gone rancid.<br /><br />Since I am writing, I also want to say it has bugged me for years that AMAZON continues to misrepresent the maker of LaraBars in the title of the product \"LaraBar\" by \"LaraBar\".  I suppose this is because people who generally buy raw food product are not usually the same people who support multinational food conglomerates like General Mills.  But it just makes me think that Amazon thinks consumers are ignorant.  I feel insulted every time I see it.\n",

If you've ever enjoyed tres leches cake, eaten a spoonful of sweetened condensed milk straight from the can, or delighted in the taste of dulce de leche, then you will likely adore these candies as well.<br /><br />About the size of a small marble, these cream-colored hard candies melt slowly into a rich, sweet milky flavor that manages to avoid being too cloyingly sweet. If you're the kind to crunch your candies, these will offer a pleasant resistance and crack/crunch satisfyingly under your teeth. The flavor is superb; I prefer to savor mine slowly, sometimes enjoying one along with a rich cup of dark coffee to enhance the sweet milky taste.<br /><br />Unlike any candy flavor found in traditional US markets, Japanese milk candies are a special treat. These Mikakuto Tokuno UHA 8.2 milk candies are the cream of the crop--the best of the best! You'll definitely want to purchase these in bulk.\n",

I'm diabetic type II and there is nothing else in hot chocolate that comes close without being loaded with sugar. Diabetes really narrows the field when it comes to things you can eat or drink so am glad that Stephens makes this product. In every shiny white cloud there is a bit of soot hiding somewhere. The lump of coal is that they don't sell it in Canada and won't ship across the border. That is so sad. Canadians having to deal with yet another item they can't get. Not sure why this is whether US government, Canadian border guards with a grudge, or Stephens just don't want extra paper work.

We wouldn't put blenders, food processors or most appliances away wet, treat the babycook the same way.  In addition, make sure only water is placed in the reservoir (i.e. without any trace foods which could occur when making multiple batches)<br /><br />2) Mold on the blade - as shown in the instruction booklet: remove the gasket and cleaning is simple as using a sponge or a brush.  It's really hard to get into the grooves without removing the rubber seal.  Reattaching it is super easy as well.<br /><br />3) Brown murky water - usually because of the after effects of descaling.  Vinegar browns when scalded so it is likely that this is the cause.  To remedy, as per the instructions, run a couple cycles to rinse out your unit. Common sense tip: regular descaling doesn't mean a couple months in between.  It means every week if you use your babycook daily.\n",

      "My Wire Fox Terrier Loves Them!!!\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "These are my 3 year old wire fox terrier's favorite treats of all, and he's a picky little guy.  He's not a big fan of even smoked, flavored rawhides, and sometimes may even turn his nose up at a smoked pig ear (though that is rare and usually just when he's pouting).  These he NEVER turns down, and he goes absolutely berserk when I open the pack and he smells aroma wafting down.  And they do have a fairly strong, though not unpleasant odor - fairly citrusy.  That's not too surprising, because these treats are full of vitamin C, which according to the packaging is important for canine dental health (I assume lack of vitamin C in a dog's diet can cause a similar condition to scurvy).  Since Vitamin C is a non water soluble vitamin, it is important not to overdose your dog (water soluble vitamins like B vitamins are nearly impossible to overdose on because you/your dog will just pee excess vitamin out, but with non water soluble vitamins like vitamin C, it can accumulate in the body and, in excess, cause harm), so stick to the recommended daily \"dose\" on the packaging.  Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to neatly break them into smaller pieces (I don't even bother), so these are not ideal training treats.<br /><br />As for how long these treats last, I think that depends on your dog's breed and your individual dog. They are each rather dense and heavy.  My little wire fox tends to demolish things pretty quickly - he consumes a large smoked pig ear in less than five minutes, he once ripped a plank of wood off the side of the garage while trying to get to a groundhog, etc, and these treats last him about 30 seconds.  One thing that I found interesting about these treats in particular is that, though he seems to love the flavor, he also seems compelled to drink a healthy several gulps from his water bowl after finishing one.  Surely enough, the packaging says to make sure your pet has access to water when given these treats.  So, two things I think are important to mention: don't overfeed these treats to your pet, and make sure your pet has access to water.  The package says max 2 treats per day; he's a little guy so I just give him one.<br /><br />As far as his breath is concerned, I haven't really noticed any change, perhaps it has an added citrus scent for a few minutes after he finishes the treat, but that's it.  I don't think these are breath-freshening so much as they supply the dog important nutrients for his/her oral health, but perhaps some people like the added citrus scent to their pet's breath.  They're not a substitute for tooth brushing (or using a brushless tooth cleaner), but they do make an excellent treat!<br /><br />So, in summary: wonderful treat that dogs love, not great for training because it can't be broken down, contains vitamin C for oral health so you don't want to give your dog too many in one day, and very mildly freshens breath for a few minutes, and takes a 25 pound terrier about 30 seconds to consume, so it is something of a cross between a nutritious treat and a short-lived toy.\n",

      "My 14 year-old cat was diagnosed with Diabetes and Chronic Renal Failure earlier this year; it was devastating. I had to administer insulin shots to him twice a day and twice he had hypo-glycemia due to the enormous challenge of balancing insulin levels. Worse, he was miserable and wary of me.<br /><br />At 16 lbs, he was overweight even for a large frame cat so I promptly began an intensive internet research (agree with the earlier poster who cautions against the foods prescribed by vets and sold in grocery stores) and after narrowing the field of high-protein pet foods, decided to try wet food. I was nervous because I had been guilty of feeding my baby delicious, awful-for-him dry foods (I was clueless) so I had no idea how long the transition to Wellness wet would take.<br /><br />There was no transition: He loved the food immediately and the switch was painless. Best, he lost 4 lbs in about 6 months, his blood sugar has stabilized and he's off insulin, hopefully permanently.<br /><br />Wellness isn't cheap, but when compared with the cost of losing a beloved furry member of the family too soon, the price is well-justified!<br /><br />ps.

      "Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.<br /><br />Pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.\n",

Why would anyone put cornstarch in baby food? Makes no sense. Both firms provide the same amount of protein but Beechnut uses only chicken and broth (from water), no fattening cornstarch.<br /><br />I use the food for my cat, btw, not a baby. Twice a day, I mix a T.  with Green Magma and Solid Gold Seameal. It's a super-healthy combo for an older cat. He seems to prefer the Beechnut as he cleans up the plate better. There's also less waste from the jar because every bit comes out cleanly (with Gerbers, the cornstarch makes it \"gooey\" and there's always some left behind).\n",

      "I like to provide variety for the cats, however, I like to stick with single protein sources.  So in addition to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0\">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.  I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0\">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.\n",

You can't reuse the K-cup too many times either as the filter inside rips or just wears out. There is one thing you must also remember...when you put your original k-cup in the first time unused, the machine punctured a hole in the bottom of cup, when you are going to put in your used cup with this lid you must line up the original hole else it will puncture a new one each time you use it.

Scottish Style (sic) Porridge Oats but I love oats and wanted to try some from \"the Auld Sod,\" so she very kindly surprised me with some from her personal stash.<br />I tend to prefer a sturdy rolled oat which these are not: they're small and thin. But they cook up to a comforting, creamy mass that's not only good with milk and a sweetener but plain with a bit of salt (which I always include) as well. The flavor is lovely--very \"oatey,\" and like all whole grains, they stick to your ribs in a satisfying manner. Cooking one cup according to package directions yields two enormous servings that could economically and healthfully provide a delicious breakfast for several hungry children, if you're so inclined. Tip: try toasting them in the pot, stirring constantly (careful--they burn quickly), until they smell nice, then add your pre measured water and cook according to package directions.<br />My satisfaction was such that I was motivated to buy a bag of Flahavan's Jumbo Oat Flakes (they're also available organic) while shopping at our local Irish market yesterday and I fully expect them to be as good the Progress Oatlets. Now, if they'd just stock the Pinhead Oatmeal, I'd be a completely happy woman.<br />Update: not unpredictably, I like the (non-organic) Jumbo Oat Flakes even more than these and am glad I made the investment. I'd review them on their own but Amazon doesn't stock them. I'll buy the organic next time and my vendor has promised to order Flahavan's Pinhead Oatmeal as well. Since Amazon actually carries it, I'll review it once I've bought it.<br />BTW, the name is pronounced 'FLAvans (kinda like \"taverns\" without the r).\n",

      "The five star system doesn't work well when the product is excellent but the packaging is terrible. I give the order two stars because several bottles were not sealed and leaked all over the box and the other bottles.  This company needs to totally rethink the sealing method it uses so that the product arrives clean and dry. It was a real mess and I had to spend a lot of time dealing with cleaning it up.  In addition to the mess, I have chosen to refrigerate the unsealed bottles to avoid possible spoilage.  This takes up valuable space in the fridge for something I had planned on simply shelving in the pantry.  Had the order arrived as I expected, I would give this product five stars.\n",

      "These taste great but they are small bars.  My biggest complaint is that I have to eat these while standing over a sink or trash to avoid making a mess.  I've gone through 6 or 7 boxes and not one package has had two completely intact bars.  Most of the time there are just lots of crumbles from the edges of the bars but occasionally you'll find a bar that was jostled around enough to be broken into three or more pieces.  Certainly, this is a combination of the composition of the granola bar and lack of completely protective packaging.  But be warned that you will have lots of crumbled Clif Crunch bars if you order this through Amazon.\n",

      "I can't say enough good things about the Lotus Wholesome Chicken dog food... we recently discovered this brand through our local pet store/groomer/doggy day care, which is known for carrying high quality and mostly natural/holistic brands of food.  We have a very hard time with one of our dogs, he is the pickiest little guy and will skip a meal or two because he gets bored with his food and refuses to eat it.  I have tried just about every high quality brand out there, always wanting the best for my four legged kids, and some of them, he won't even give the time of day.  This is THE FIRST food where he actually jumps up and down when it's dinner time!!!  He loves it, and I love that we're feeding such a high quality food.  The thing that sets Lotus apart from almost every other dog food out there is that it's baked, which helps in retaining a lot of the nutrients and protein, as well as the flavor.  It's packed with lots of high quality meat, grains, fruits and veggies, and everything is sourced in the U.S. and Canada(in the Chicken recipe... the Lamb is from New Zealand).<br /><br />One thing I have noticed, compared to other foods, is that it also has a much milder smell to it.  It just smells like something freshly baked(like tiny little cookies for dogs!).  Some other foods, which are very good, high quality foods, have an overpowering odor.  I think that might be part of the reason our dog turns his nose up at them, because it's too smelly.<br /><br />Luckily Lotus does offer a Small Bites formula in Chicken, Lamb, and Grain-Free Duck, because the regular adult formulas do have a pretty large-sized kibble that might be hard for smaller dogs(like mine).<br /><br />I hope my review helps spread the good word about Lotus and that other doggy parents will give it a try, your dogs will love you for it! :)\n",

      "I drink 2 cups of coffee from a Mr. Coffee each morning. I prefer the medium roast and like to smooth it by using creamer or milk to cut the bitterness. If I want something hot later on a winter day, I make some tea. I read others comments before trying this brand so I would know how to compare my taste with others.<br /><br />First experiment: I made one cup of coffee using one pouch. I liked the smooth taste and did not have to add creamer. It was weak. But the more I thought about it the more I recognized that this was just like drinking tea. So I think a tea lover would enjoy this as a different flavor.<br /><br />Second experiment: I made a second cup of coffee by piling a new pouch on the one I had used previously. Now the coffee was definitely stronger. It was still very smooth. I would rate this as a medium strength but on the light side.<br /><br />Third experiment: I made two cups of coffee using one pouch plus a scoop of my regular coffee. This tasted just like my normal coffee but retained the smoothness so I did not need creamer. So this may be the answer for those who wanted more flavor.<br /><br />Fourth experiment: I brewed two cups of coffee using one pouch. Then I moved the pouch to the carafe and squeezed it about 6 times. The coffee darkened noticeably and got a stronger flavor. This turned out to be the most satisfying for my taste.\n",

      "I volunteer at a cat shelter so over time I've had some experience with what cats like and what they don't.  With a few rare exceptions, it is hard to find cat treats that are popular with mostly all of the cats.  So far, Natural Temptations Wild Alaskan Salmon Flavor, Natural Temptations Tuna Flavor and All Natural Temptations Chicken Flavor are proving to be three of the rare exceptions.  Just about all the kitties love these things and will follow me around when I'm handing them out so they can cadge more.  Because they are all natural and only 2 calories per treat, they are a reasonably safe and nutritious treat.  Because they are inexpensive, I can afford to bring enough for everybody at every visit!  And apparently they taste awesome.  I can buy these at my local grocery, Target, Walmart or pet store for around $1.50 to $2.00 a packet and each packet contains enough treats to provide every kitty in the shelter with a generous serving of treats. There is one negative - these treats contain a lot of grains and as a result some kitties will vomit them up after an hour (some kitties tummies will not tolerate food or treats containing grain, or more than very small amounts of grain); over the last few months I've had 3 or 4 kitties through the shelter with this issue.  Once I've identified a kitty who is grain-intolerant, I naturally do not feed it these treats or anything similar.  Note that there are several versions of the Whiskas treats that are not all natural; the kitties like them also but I prefer to feed the all natural version.\n",

Plus, it's a 'health food' with all the antioxidants!<br /><br />After trying the dark whole bean for a while, though, I decided to switch back to dark ground.  I always transfer my new coffee to mason jars, and noticed with the whole beans that that tea will eventually settle to the bottom of the jar leaving the whole beans at the top.  So, I have switched back to dark ground, which always stays evenly mixed.  By keeping it in the mason jars, it stays fresh until consumed.<br /><br />Whole bean or ground are both GREAT!  i love Tieman's fusion coffee and feel better by drinking it!\n",

I started using glycerin soap when I found out that it cleans as well as regular soap but doesn't leave soap scum to muck up the bath/shower. When I saw this as a choice on Vine, I thought, \"What the heck? Give it a try. You can always clean off the scum.\"<br /><br />This product cleans well and leaves a slippery feeling to the skin (we have softened water) when rinsed off, but it leaves a very obvious aftershave-like smell: it actually work me up several times during the night the one-time I used it to shower with. So, no more showers with this for me! However, I am using it during the day to wash the old armpits. It really does clean and de-smellify well.<br /><br />Added after reading the previous reviews: there is a \"technical problem\" with the container. The lid is on the bottom and not easy to open when your hands are wet.

I was just going to start using it again after a 4-month elimination diet and discovered that it now has wheat gluten!! This is very disappointing. The only gluten free product by this company that I've tried (GF English Muffins) were awful. I tried one and threw away the package. It felt like a I swallowed a rock of goo. My gut hurt for a couple days and I ended up needing to do special remedies for acute constipation :( Additionally, their regular English muffins have barley malt, which I avoid because of my gluten sensitivity.

      "------------------\n",
      "After reading the book \"Deadly Feasts\" I was horrified to learn what kinds of items may end up in my dogs' food! I started researching different dog foods and consistently received the same brand recommendations: Innova, Canidae, Wellness, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul...etc. I initially settled on Canidae, but also tried Wellness on a recommendation. The Wellness produced loose stools in two of my foster poodles, so I no longer use that brand. The Canidae, however, is perfect for my multi dog household, which often includes dogs ranging from puppyhood to senior status. The ingredients are phenomenal and, as all reviewers have said, the food contains no corn, wheat or soy, all common allergens in dogs. Although I also use and would recommend Innova Evo dry dog food, Canidae costs $35 for 40 pounds and Innova costs about $50 for a 28 pound bag. So, if you are budgeting a bit but would still like to give your dog the best, Canidae is great. After switching my dogs to Canidae, I noticed several things. First, my labrador retriever's coat sheen increased to the point of nearly blinding me in the sunglight; second, he lost about 10 pounds and developed greater muscle tone (although he was always fed recommended portions of commercial foods); third, my shedding dogs shed a lot less than in the past; and fourth, bad doggy breath is greatly reduced. I see no excuse not to switch your dog from a commercial food to Canidae or another super premium brand - it costs no more than a fancy bag of Iams or Science Diet, but can add quality years to your pets' lives! If you own a dog prone to allergies, such as a poodle, this food can't be beat. I had a family adopt a 5-pound malipoo from me and they emailed me to say they cannot feed him anything other than Canidae or he develops loose stools and needs to be taken out to the bathroom contantly. For your dog's sake switch their food; you can do a lot better than chain-store foods!\n",

      "In reading the three reviews written thus far, I more fully appreciate the reasons why voters of the United States elected George W. Bush to serve a second term as President of their country.<br /><br />We like what is familar and often lack exposure to options and the set of skills needed to guide us in developing discriminating taste.  Nostalgia governs our feelings about food.  When I was growing up cheese-like particles in cardboard cylinders were the only alternative to orange squares of individually wrapped processed cheese.  Thus, I was content to shake the stuff on top of my bowls of Campbell's soup.  Life was fine.  Even better when the surface where the powdery substance fell was pizza or spaghetti.  It offered an interesting textural contrast and proved a relatively inexpensive source for sodium.<br /><br />Then as I grew up and the world changed along with me.  I met people who spoke different languages and visited and lived in their countries.  I learned the difference between the processed and highly industrialized foods I grew up eating and the kinds of fresh produce I could find on a market street in France or a piazza in front of a church in Italy.  After becoming comfortable inside foreign supermarkets, I explored small cheese shops, bakeries, charcuteries and butcher's stores.  Back home, brave, determined souls with more vision than I began businesses, farms and urban markets that translated what is good about European artisanal foods and farms into American terms.  Immigrants from around the world also enriched our culinary lives by bringing their beloved traditions here.<br /><br />However good a goat cheese from Vermont can be, it is not the same as a living chevre from a small region in France.  Even if Kraft were interested in making that kind cheese, the size of the corporation prohibits such a process.  Nor  could it ever reproduce the exquisite character of Parmigiano-Reggiano.  The craft of making this regional cheese from Parma has been refined over centuries by a consortium of cheese makers.  It depends upon great skill.  Cows eat grass and breathe different air, factors that contribute to the kind of milk they produce.  That milk becomes enormous wheels that are aged for a minimum of two years, preferably three, until pale crystals form in the golden surface that cracks unevenly as a trained cheese monger thrusts a pick into a newly opened cheese.  The taste is pronounced rather than sharp to the tongue, buttery, sweet yet mellow, nutty and utterly one of the best things one might ever experience in life.<br /><br />I urge you to take advantage of the fact that you are able to buy authentic Parmigiano-Reggiano imported from Parma, Italy these days. Look for the words \"PARMIGIANO REGGIANO\" perforated on the surface of the rind in black dots with a red insignia.  These are signs that you are getting the real thing.  It's not inexpensive, but then again, it isn't cheap either.  Price is a lot less than the bill for a new flat-screen TV.<br /><br />Serve it in small chunks, room temperature, with ripe fresh pears or grated on top of your favorite dishes where it actually melts.  Let Kraft continue to corrupt American culture and prepare our country's citizens for years of obesity, mediocrity and high dental bills.  You, on the other hand, can lead a better life without the shiny little green cylinder of cheese-like  processed goods.\n",

For whatever reason, I missed the pod image in the picture, so when I received this I ended up using several pods to create a full pot of coffee. This did impact anyone who is wondering what it might be like to brew one individual pod, which I will try to brew with my father's french press. Anywho, on with the review. I just wanted to be up front when I say that my experience might not be like that of someone who owns a Senseo.<br /><br />Smell-wise, this stuff is awesome. It smelled great when I was brewing it, which is honestly about 30-40% of what I (and many others) enjoy most about coffee. Taste-wise, this was pretty good. It's definitely a dark roast, so if you prefer a more mild flavor then you'll probably want to look elsewhere. (Not sure if Marley coffee has a lighter roast, but they probably should.) It's not Charbucks, so no worries about it being too roasted.<br /><br />I brewed this at work and after the pre-requisite jokes about a \"pot\" of coffee and such, we all set about to consuming it. Now while we do have to put up with some of the worst free coffee possible, it only serves to help us appreciate the good stuff when it comes along, and this is some good stuff and was pretty well received. I had a lot of people that came back and told me that they really enjoyed the brew. (For food items, if I can get a wider opinion, I try to do so because hey- not all opinions are the same when it comes to any product.) So if you have a Senseo that multiple people use or if you're considering buying a regular bag for multiple people to use, this is something you can get for a wide audience of drinkers.<br /><br />I have to say, this is something that I'd actually purchase with my own money later on down the line. It's a good coffee and while I don't base my purchases on the whole \"organic, fair trade\" stuff, I know that others do and I have to admit that it is nice to think that the coffee purchase potentially helped someone other than myself. (The whole organic, fair trade thing didn't really factor into my opinion, but I know that this is important to some consumers so I wanted to make sure to make a note of this since the product description for this didn't have any of this in it.)\n",

It was even better than I expected and I went back to buy 6 more boxes. This is honestly one of the best teas I've ever had (amazing because I was addicted to Chai tea for years) but I wouldn't recommend it black; you HAVE to have it with vanilla or eggnog creamer to really bring out the flavor :)\n",

They are a bit on the pricier side since they require the addition of butter, eggs, and milk. I'd still suggest adding some fruit and good syrup when using this mix. The flavor is not particularly strong without them.<br /><br />Would I buy these again? Yes. But would I not buy another brand that was on sale in order to buy this? No.\n",

When I called to follow-up and provide the correct information, I was told the product would be shipped but the estimated time came and went and still no product. As my baby was running out of formula, I called again to follow-up that same evening and was given a bizarre story that the listing was a fraud and that I would not be receiving the product and should cancel my credit card. I did so and about an hour later, the product arrived. In the meantime, I had cancelled my credit card and had to wait for a new card and re-establish all the connections.\n",

But, heck, they're graham crackers, right, so what are you expecting?  To me, an exciting graham cracker is one that delivers a top-notch graham cracker experience (not worrying about being anything else), and if it can do so with a little less processing, that really IS exciting.

And it worked!<br /><br />This coffee, when brewed as above in a Keurig on the medium cup size, produces a deep, rich, robust cup of coffee heaven. There's no bitterness,  just smooth, rich, deep flavor with a slight acidic tingle. It's not the blend for someone who likes light to medium blends.

I also successfully removed a small grease stain from my garage floor, which isn't as practical as it is possible because you have to use a majority of the hot sauce.<br /><br />The sauce itself is unbelievably hot.

There is no pumpkin flavor, it simply has similar spices to a pumpkin pie.<br /><br />It's a smooth instant coffee, consistent with what we expect from Maxwell House's International coffees line.  The spices are very noticeable, yet not overbearing, and the blend is highly satisfactory as well, without being overpowered by any particular spice.<br /><br />Spiced coffees can be tricky, and this one is very good as a dessert coffee.

      "I'm a fan!  This tea is not bitter, and forgives a wide range of temps and steep times.  In fact, my favorite way to drink it is to throw a bag into room-temperature water to flavor the water.  This works well through 3-4 refills, by which time I tend to forget and leave the room.  Steeping for hours does finally bring the bitterness out, so that's when I toss it.<br /><br />The \"green\" flavor of the tea is much stronger than most white teas.  It reminds me of a white and green 'fusion' tea by Stash, though I prefer this Revolution tea.  The pear flavor is delicious, tastes like real pear, and matches the strength of the strong white tea (that sounds funny as I type it - strong white tea?!) well.  If you like green AND white tea, and you like pears, give this a shot.  I'm really very fond of it.<br /><br />The package comes with a \"resealable freshness bag,\" though I've never felt the need for one before and I'm not sure I need one now.  It doesn't get in the way, and it's there if I want to travel without risking leaking tea dust . . . not that there is any tea dust.  The tea leaves are as large as loose leaf tea, which might be why it holds up through more steeps than anything else I have in a teabag, and they're very green.  I suspect it still has more moisture in the leaves than most teas, but since I'm reluctant to rip a bag open to perform tests, that will remain a suspicion.<br /><br />There's no string on the teabags, and they're the fancy pyramid type.  They feel very nice.  This is a distant concern compared to the flavor (which, as I mentioned, I am very fond of), but it's worth a mention.<br /><br />Enjoy!\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "\"Wow\" would be a good place to start!  While I have had a handful of Indian restaurant experiences, the closest one to our home is at least an hour away.  I found these sauces at a local closeout retailer for about $2.00 a bottle and thought I'd give this a try.  We love the taste of cardamon and lemongrass in our home so it was worth the risk.  I made some roasted chicken, and cut up carrots, onions, and red peppers to combine with this sauce and paired it with some Basmati rice.  Upon first taste, Hubby and I were hooked and I headed to both discount retailers in our town the very next day to buy out what  was left of it which turned out to be about 5 more bottles in all. I will be disappointed when it's all gone since nobody else, not even Kroger, seems to sell this product.  Amazon will have to be my source for more of it if we don't tire of it before it expires.  Tonight we're having Sharwood's Red Thai Curry Sauce which I'll combine with chickpeas, shrimp, and acorn squash along with some home made garlic naan.  I hope we like this as much...looks like another trip to closeout \"Lots\" tomorrow if we do.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of \"Brian Amazon\" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief...

When I have the time I use unflavored protein powder in a smoothie, but for days where that's just not possible Orgain has been an excellent substitute. I have tried chocolate and mocha, and both are great tasting. I prefer the mocha because I feel like I'm getting my coffee fix for the day--and though this stuff is caffiene free I feel energized without the jitters! It's a good breakfast, though occassionally I get an upset stomach after drinking it. I haven't been able to pinpoint why, but it's something to keep in mind if you have a sensitive stomach.<br /><br />I also drink orgain on my workout days, half a shake beforehand and the other half afterward. Even though it's expensive, I don't drink it every day, and my monthly subscription for just a 12-pack has done me well for a while now. For me, it's worth the money to have meal replacement that is easy and tasty.\n",

He usually breezes by whenever he feels like it to eat the dry food I leave in his bowl. Since I have been giving him Petite Cuisine, he is ready and waiting by his bowl at meal time. I have to push his head out of the way so that I can finish emptying the can into his dish.<br /><br />Most canned cat foods look like fishy hummus or strange, extruded rubbery strips, but this food looks just like what you get when you open a can of tuna, except with more sauce. The shrimp flavor has tiny recognizable shrimp in it.<br /><br />Full Crazy Cat Lady Disclosure: Before I would let my babies eat a new cat food, I did a little (ok, hours) of due diligence research on Petite Cuisine. After the Chinese pet food debacle, I wasn't about to let them eat food produced by an unknown foreign entity. According to what I could find on the internet, PetPlay Inc. is a relatively new American startup by CEO Eric Weber. He has years of experience with the premium cat food market; was part of the team that launched the Fancy Feast brand and ran the Friskies Japan division (both part of the Nestle SA family).<br /><br />(According to the SoCal Buzz podcast I listened to, he even worked for Hello Kitty. I particularly loved his remark about cat owners being \"a little more illogical\" than other pet owners, therefore they are more likely to spend money for premium products - I resemble that remark.)<br /><br />Yes, the cat food is produced in Thailand, but it is not associated with any of the companies involved in recalls for Thailand or China, and is not on any of the FDA's lists. They have nutritional facts and a nutrient analysis for each product readily available on their website [...]\n",

But after he gave it a few sniffs, it was chowed down in minutes. Timmy quickly devoured what appeared to be a delicacy to him.<br /><br />To me, it looked too healthy to appeal to a feline, with its obvious chunks of veggies and solid pieces of meat, nicely moistened by a broth. The can is compact and easy to store and the portion size is just right for one cat's healthy appetite. Normally, a regular can of food like Friskies or Whiskas will only get half eaten, but there was no waste here. The food was polished off with a meticulous licked-clean plate, evidence of Timmy's approval of this latest offering.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine is not cheap, but it is on the lower end for the \"gourmet\" cat foods and you get quality ingredients.  Each 4-pack I received also came with coupons worth up to $2 in savings so that is an added bonus.<br /><br />All in all, a good cat food worth it's cost.

      "------------------\n",
      "The Lickety Stick is truly a unique product. It's basically a rollerball bottle (like some deodorants) with different flavored syrups (like chicken, beef, or bacon). I've never seen anything like it. The promo video says dogs love the taste and it's very low cal (oddly, the video also warns of an epidemic of pet obesity, which while probably is true, I had never heard it described in such catastrophic and somber tones). The treat is on the high price end of what dog treats usaully cost, but the maker boasts each bottle contains over 500 licks. I've been trying to figure out if that's a good deal. Normal-sized treat bags don't usually have 500 treats, but on the other hand, you would never just give your dog 1 lick off this thing.<br /><br />If your dog likes the Lickety Stick (there are review testimonies here going both ways), then it's left up to you how long puppy gets to lick, so the touted cost-effectiveness could quickly evaporate (there is no recommended serving size on the bottle). All in all, the Lickety Stick reminds me of a sugar free lollipop. They can have a decent flavor, but not everyone will like them; they don't have calories, so they're \"healthier;\" and because they're calorie free, they don't fill you up at all, which leaves me with a final thought.<br /><br />Regular dog treats do at least have a substance factor; they are a solid food. The Lickety Stick is a calorie free liquid, so the filling factor is missing. And so while Charlie did enjoy the Lickety Stick, she probably won't be getting another one. She is already in great physical condition, eats an organic dog food regimented according to the bag-recommended diet, and is taking C9 vitamin supplements. Basically, she gets enough health stuff is what I'm saying; so when she does get a treat, I want her to enjoy it like the treat that it is. I'm not convinced the Lickety Stick does that. Now, if you are trying to wean your pet off table food or lower their weight, this product could probably help you do that.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "While these are tasty snacks, there is virtually no nutritional value in them.  A quick check of the label shows insignificant amounts of and vitamins, even vitamin C, in any of the varieties.  By insignificant, I mean less than 10% RDA.  That is far below what one might find in the claimed 1-1/2 apples or pears per package.  I will add that under ingredients, the only thing listed is the freeze-dried fruit on the label; there appear to be no additives, not even sugar, of any kind.  While they are not strictly bad for you, this snack certainly qualifies as empty calories.  Frankly you get more vitamins from a bag of potato chips.<br /><br />In addition, these are made in China, this is stated on each envelope.  Draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />Finally, the package counts are deceptive.  The subtexts often says \"24 count\".  Then in Amazon inset says \"2 pack\".  This leads a reasonable person to believe they are getting 2 24 packs for a total of 48 individual snack envelopes.  In fact these are sold in packs of 12 (TWELVE) and you get two of them for a total of 24.  I find this deceptive, or at best, confusing.<br /><br />[Update, May 2012:  It appears that the description of the item has been changed to avoid the confusion as to how many you are actually getting.]<br /><br />To conclude, these are tasty, the texture is good, there seems to be no odd ingredients, refined sugar or artificial stuff and the serving size is reasonable.  However, the utter absence of any nutritional value tells me that the process used to \"freeze-dry\" these seems different from other freeze-dry methods in that it is particularly destructive to nutrients.  I find the fact that they are made in China troubling.  Finally, the deceptive package counts found here in the product descriptions lead me not to purchase this again.

I also like that I can reuse some of the plastic K-cups.<br /><br />Update: I've been using the K-caps for a couple of months now, and have had the time to sample several different Keurig K-cups. I drink mostly decaf coffee and there are not a lot of flavor choices available in K-cups. The decaf kinds that I HAVE tried all seem to be a dark roast or bold, which is not really my preferred coffee type apparently. I've gone back to mostly using the K-caps with my favorite decaf coffee - Harry and David's Moose Munch, and the coffee is perfectly brewed every time. Not too dark, not too bold, not too strong, not watered down, but just right! I love that I can have my favorite coffee and the K-caps are MUCH neater than the My K-cup that came with our Keurig.\n",

These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.

      "------------------\n",
      "I have one great vice in life.  Sweet, sweet caffeine.  Oh, how I love it so.  For a man who has a habit of burning the candle at both ends way too often, caffeine is like a breakfast essential (as well as lunch, dinner, and several other times during the day)!  However, coffee really irritates my stomach, and I'm not a big tea fan.  Until I found Element, my only previous answer for this problem was soda (because I am also not exactly the No Doze or Vivarin type - \"Look, I'm wide awake!  Boy does my stomach hurt and I've really got to go to the bathroom, but after that, it's go time!\").  For those of you soda lovers out there, I understand your struggle.  \"Do I drink the diet soda that tastes like crap because of artificial sweetener, and lie to myself that it tastes good just long enough to get that sweet, sweet caffeine into my system?\" OR \"Do I drink the regular soda and gain 5 pounds...today?!!\"  Folks, your search for a solution is over.  I give you Element Caffeinated Water!!  And, if you are super Amazon-savvy like me, you were smart enough to search under caffeinated water and discover Water Joe as well (ha ha).  I'm not going to lie, they taste almost identical - in that they are both water!!  Once you purify/distill water, there can only be so much variance in taste without added flavors, which make it less pure.  However, there is one added difference.  Element includes an extra ingredient in their water, along with the caffeine, to help improve focus and concentration while the caffeine does its job of keeping you awake and amping you up for whatever it is that you are trying to confuse your exhausted body into doing!  I realize that I can get down from my soapbox (podium for those of you who need a younger reference) after complaining about adding things like flavors to water, making it less pure, while meanwhile the caffeine itself is an additive - even if it is a naturally occurring source of caffeine.  However, HELLO!!!  Which part of \"caffeine is my one great vice in life\" did you not understand?!!\n",

The exfoliating granules are very mild and the aloe makes this extra soothing. After one use you can see results in tone/texture and moisture balance, after three uses, you may find yourself ordering a second tube. It is that impressive.

I cut open the bag and was knocked back back a beautiful and incredibly tempting coffee aroma!<br />This had a really good flavor, nice and full, not bitter.<br />After trying it at 10oz, i then re-brewed (@6oz) the same pack to fill my 16oz cup.<br />The filter held up extremely well and the coffee still tasted delicious and not watered down.<br />There were no chunks of bean in my cup as I finished, some fine powdery grounds, but I get more when i double brew a k-cup.<br /><br />So pluses:<br />Coffee tastes good<br />Slightly less trash than a K-Cup<br />A WHOLE LOT cheaper than K-Cup<br />Organic<br />Sealed into small quantity packs<br />To be able to smell your coffee beans<br />Multiple roast strengths and decaf are available.<br />Did I mention it tastes good?<br /><br />Cons:<br />Still pricier than bulk coffee<br />Sealed in 8 count pouches, so if you don't drink frequently you will have to re-vacuum.<br />Storage, it is a little more inconvenient than being able to stack the k-cups in the drawer, but I have plenty of room.<br />No selection of flavored coffees (yet, according to their website they are coming soon)<br /><br />I applaud the manufacturer for improving on the k-cup, and for producing a finely roasted bean!<br />I cannot remember the last time I actually thanked a company for their product, but I will now!<br />Thank You San Francisco Bay Coffee!<br />You have a new fan!\n",

      "I switched my mini-Schauzers over to Newman's Own Organics a month ago when they came off of their puppy chow.  I've been looking for a good quality dog food (rated 4 stars by dogfoodadvisor.com) without going into debt purchasing it!  I was feeding them a different brand that was \"breed-specific\" food, but was having trouble trying to find it in stock anywhere.  A few places, if they carried it at all, only carried the very small bags (2.5 lbs) and with two dogs, one bag would last about 3 - 5 days.  Plus these little 2.5 lb. bags cost more than half what the larger 10 lb. bag  cost!  I tried to make an arrangement to have one of the places order the larger bag for me, but they conveniently \"forgot\" to place the order, so I was stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags.  Then I heard about Newman's Own Organics, which is rated a better dog food than the \"breed-specific\" food I was using and cost $$$ less!  And then I discovered that I could buy this food at Amazon.com, have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for signing up for the subscription plan delivery - no brainer!!  No more running out of food, no more driving 50 miles or more to find it, no more hassels!<br /><br />And best and most importantly of all, my little guys LOVE IT!!  Their stools firmed up almost immediately after starting the switchover, they seem more active, more alert, more regular and they actually chew this food (they inhaled their puppy chow without chewing!)  I can't say enough good things about both Newman's Own and Amazon's subscription delivery service!\n",

They are drops that need to be dissolved in the mouth, releasing sweet caramel flavor and vitamins as they slowly dissipate.<br /><br />Honees Energy Plus Vitamin- Caramel have a pleasant flavor that is very much like a piece of caramel flavored hard candy. In essence, that is exactly what they are: Candy, but with added vitamins. They are sweet and pleasant to eat, with a sugary sweetness that most will find pleasant enough to recommend. And they have added B6, B12, and C vitamins for good health and other benefits.<br /><br />I have nothing against placing additional vitamins in my body and Honees Energy Plus Vitamin- Caramel are certainly better than the average candy for that reason alone. Supposedly, they offer an energy benefit as well, but I cannot see how one of these small drops should be expected to add energy. Looking at the ingredients, sugar is about the only significant energy- enhancing ingredient, but even the sugar content isn't that much and it isn't nearly enough to boost one's overall energy level. I felt no different after taking one of these than I did before.<br /><br />Honees Energy Plus Vitamin- Caramel are relatively inexpensive and they do offer more than standard candy, so I suppose they have their usefulness. I wish there was some actual energy enhancement because it would come in very handy during the mid afternoon when I often find myself feeling a little sluggish at work. But the product does have added vitamins and a pleasant caramel taste, and this is enough to convince me to award these with an average rating overall.\n",

      "Yes, they should call it \"Cat Crack\". We have 5 extremely finicky cats, and it's very difficult to get them to eat the same thing. When we find something, we stick with it. Whenever we've tried to introduce something new, chances are 1 or 2 of them will turn up their noses and walk away.<br /><br />This has not been an issue with Petite Cuisine. The problem now is that they truly won't stop sceaming for it. We've now gone through each of the four flavors (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, and Tuna & Shrimp), and each is an unqualified hit with all five cats.<br /><br />You can tell as soon as you open the can that this is something different. It certainly smells fishy, but it doesn't smell like regular canned cat food. It looks and smells very high quality and fresh. Real tuna flakes, real tiny popcorn shrimp, a good amount of sauce. These are smaller 3 oz cans. We pretty much limit each cat to a healthy tablespoon of wet food a day, so 1 can will feed three like that. But the cats could certainly find the motivation to eat more.<br /><br />Each box (and each can) is clearly labelled with all of the ingredients, which for the most part are whole seafood. Not too thrilled with the presence of Menadione sodium bisuifite in each, but on the whole, it's probably no more risky than other foods we've been feeding them. 1/2 star off for that.<br /><br />Value? Well it's a little pricey (3x per oz more expensive than, say, a good deal on a can of Friskies. But we'll continue to get it for the occasional break and special night treat for our babies. It's certainly been better received than almost anything else we've paid a premium for from any grocery store or pet store.\n",

This means that you don't have to cut them up or break them into little pieces (I'm looking at you, Buddy Biscuits), but your dog will still go the distance to earn them.  The small size makes them super convenient.  I have used the peanut butter, chicken, and salmon flavors.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the salmon flavor has an awful stench.  I am used to reeking like dog treats, but the salmon odor is too much.  Upon opening the bag for the first time, I gagged.  Even now, several months after purchasing the 1lb bag, I am still trying to get rid of these treats.  I tried passing them off on my mother, but she wouldn't take them because of the smell.  Yesterday I decided I would just bite the bullet and use them for training for a few days, but after just a couple minutes in the bag I use for treats, I gave up.  I just couldn't take it.  I stuck them back in the bag they came in.  I think I will mix the remaining treats with a giant glob of peanut butter to try to get rid of them in one stinky fell swoop.<br /><br />So Zuke's: we love you.  You have a great mission that both my dog and I both appreciate in our own ways.  The salmon mini naturals, however, definitely miss the mark.

In one sense, i thought it was 45 cookies per package, with 3 packages - thus, 45 x 3, but then i again re-read the info, and i gather and the more likely answer is, the total is ONLY 45 cookies!!! Now, this is 'neither good' nor 'bad'. All it is, IS, you are paying pretty much the price that is on  the cookie bag if you were to buy one alone at a supermarket, but having it brought right to your door, thus shipping!  So, you are really paying the SAME PRICE of a GROCERY STORE, and little more, for 'shipping' - but, for me, I have no car, so, to have 3 bags of cookies arrive at my door, while i sit sans car, makes things only a little bit easier.  I still say, it should be 45 cookies PER BAG, with 3 bags in this total, 'special package' deal....  Cause if you think about it, it DID SHOW THE PRICE OF $25 AND UP with a line thru it, thus, implying you were getting over 100 cookies!  Cause why on earth would someone pay, 25$ for the product, alone, then the 7$ shipping on it, if it were only TOTAL 45 cookies?

      "I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are ground yellow corn, corn gluten meal, and chicken by-product meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a cheap corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with cats and dogs.\" Basically, corn cannot be fully digested, it is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Friskies at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, dry foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.\n",

Bil Jacs, Red Barn, tube foods, chewy heartworm tabs, even canned food gives him problems, as in, they come back up. So dry food is the food of choice and sometimes treats, except for these. Even tho they say \"Made in China\" they also say \"Tested Safe for USA\" and so few ingredients, especially the Peas and Carrots, his fav, make me happy I can get them to make him happy. He loves them. We cut them into tiny bit size for training, and seek games, as well as, the \"Brain\" games.  Have tried other \"Made in US\" treats--No go.

      "I have been making my baby food since she was 6 months old.  These trays are fantastic and allow me to make large batches of baby food and freeze for reheating throughout the week.  I originally purchased two trays, but my 8 month old baby is eating two servings for lunch and dinner, so I ordered two more trays.  Not only are they colorful and fun, but so easy to clean and the frozen baby food pops right out after running the tray under warm water for a few seconds.  Although these trays are kind of expensive, they are totally worth the money if you only feed your baby homemade food.  I wish that these trays would have been on the market back when my son was a baby, as I had the entire door of my freeze full of small tupperwear with baby food and these trays would have made my life easier back then.  By the way, if you want to save more space in your freezer, you can just pop the baby food out of the trays and store in a freezer bag.  I absolutely love them and I highly recommend this product.\n",

      "I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of \"A Star Is Born\" the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are \"100 Calorie Packs\", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.\n",

I would compare the smell to an axe or old spice variety shampoo that is almost like a cologne, it is pleasant and not overpowering.

After using this shampoo hair feels clean and the moisturizing seems to work well. We haven't had any problems with dandruff since starting to use this product.\n",

The beans were pale, not oily and this was reflected in the pale boring taste of the brewed coffee. As soon as I opened the bag of Dark Brazilian I could see that the beans were dark and oily and the flavor was a truly rich french roast.

      "This popcorn tastes great and is comparable to the Great American brand. Even better it uses healthier sunflower oil and not coconut oil. As to the other reviews that state it's too salty, you can find the same type of reviews with many of these pre-measured packets. The good thing about this brand (as well as several others) the ingredients are separated, so you can adjust to your own taste. I don't like very much salt on my popcorn so I use 1/4 to 1/2 of the salt packet. If others are over that like saltier popcorn I get mine, and then sprinkle some more on the rest. As for reviews saying the popcorn is \"chewy\" I belive that's more the timing of heating the oil & the quality of the machine. I've done multiple taste tests with guests (as we have tried several pre-packaged brands) and this wins more frequently than others. But for me the clincher is the sunflower oil. If you want a great visual effect, put some coconut oil based mixture and sunflower oil based mixture in two clear jars and store a little below room temperature -- around 60 degrees. You'll find a solid block of oil with the cococut mixture, while the sunflower oil mixture is still liquid & see through. Not exactly what I want stuck in my arteries.\n",

      "I've had several brands of beef sticks and am not a very picky eater, so was surprised that there was a pretty big discrepancy between how this product was reviewed here and how it tasted. To me it tasted more like beef heart than beef (and I have actually sampled beef heart before, so I know what it tastes like! Not something I would buy); the skin provided some resistance but then it was very mushy on the inside. Maybe my batch had a higher proportion of that than normal? I got the hot flavor, but that did not mask the weirdness of the taste.<br /><br />The reason for two stars instead of one: I brought it with us while we were camping, and we were a little short on food. The short sticks provided sustenance even if we all grumbled a little bit about the taste. They didn't cause any diarrhea or stomach problems.<br /><br />Unlike other people I did not receive any samples from Buffalo Bills and so have no input with regards to how their other stuff tastes.\n",

A Wall Street whistleblower believes it's possible after reviewing documents from the Securities Exchange Commission.<br /><br />The SEC is already conducting an informal inquiry into Green Mountain's \"revenue recognition practices.\" And now Sam Antar, a securities expert who has worked with federal investigators, says public documents show a company executive sold thousands of shares just before the company publicly disclosed the SEC inquiry. The announcement of the inquiry was followed by a 16-percent drop in Green Mountain's stock price.<br /><br />A group of shareholders are already suing the company, alleging executives artificially inflated the stock price and cashed in before the price drop. And Antar says the timing of the stock sale is the kind of thing that could trigger an insider trading investigation.<br /><br />Not recommending this at all.

      "------------------\n",
      "I have struggled for the last year with my 3 year old son's constipation and fear of going \"poo\" on the potty. He also has been quite hyperactive in the past year; that coincided with a new brother (he is the middle child) as well as his efforts on potty training.  At the suggestion of my mother in law, we began using this product (1/2 tspn per day), and 10 days later, he began going poo on the potty with no problem at all, even asking to go, and went at school.  Prior to this, he would hold it because he was in so much pain when he went, and he never went away from the house!  We literaly BATTLED over going poo in the potty!  So this was the first miracle.  But then, within two days of that, he was back to my sweet, normal 3 year old boy and not so hyper and irritable.  He is smiling more, hugging us again, obeying simple rules and commands, and I feel like I have my son back!  I attribute all of this to the magnesium as we have not done anything different with his vitamins and diet than we had been doing for the last year.  He is also eating better, which I believe is because his tummy doesn't hurt as much now that he is regular.<br /><br />I do think I am going to cut back to 1/4 tspn/day though because the stools are a little looser, and he is taking 3 hour naps, so a little too sleepy.  But all in all, I am in LOVE with this product and highly recommend it for children as well as adults! My husband is about to start taking it to see if it helps with his sleep and his adult ADD that he suffers from.\n",

      "I've used many different body washes over the years and this one is one of the more masculine smelling ones when you compare it to the normal brands of body wash, so that is nice if you would prefer not to smell like roses or peaches.  It has a good lather without being too overly soapy and rinses off without any soapy residue after feel.  The flip top cap is nice and easy to use and I like how it is stored with the cap down so you don't have to shake it to get it out like you do with ones with the cap on the top.  So it an overall good body wash with a well designed bottle.\n",

      "I couldn't believe my luck. This little nut bar was included in my variety pack of these yummy Kind bars that I had ordered from Amazon last month. The taste and texture of this nut bar is the exact same taste as the beloved \"no bake fruit cake\" that my Nana made us when I was a little girl back in the 50s and 60s. It must be the dates and the particular kind of nuts because it tickles my taste buds in just such a way as to send me back years ago. I thank you Kind bar makers as being genius in your combinations of ingredients. I love these things... Love, love, love. I have just recently made an order with Amazon for a box of 12 of these things... and just when I remembered a book I wanted and decided to add that to my order... gosh, well, I goofed up and I hope that Amazon figures it out for me just in time because if I get all 24 of these nut bars I am in real trouble. I will eat them till they're gone. So, please, cross my fingers Amazon does their usual magic and gets my order just right! I have been invited to \"Like\" them on my Facebook page, but then I don't go there often and... well, if I tell everyone, then they may become hard to find in the future... sorta like telling everyone where your favorite fishing hole is and then not being able to go there because it's so crowded.<br /><br />Computers are so picky!  I offered to write a review of a different flavor of this Kind bar and it told me that only one review per product per customer... but I could edit my review! So, here I am. Back again to further praise and describe what has become my favorite snack food. They are so filling though, you have to watch it because it becomes a meal substitute and then your friends think you're no fun cause you won't eat with them! You're already full! The protein in these bars make them ideal for trail food, however, if you don't have the teeth for nuts, stay away. This last bar I decided I'd praise is the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TNANSO\">KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>. I found them in my local grocery store but they often run out and that's what sent me to Amazon for a check on their availability. Yum! Lucky me! So, I'm out. I ate all I ordered last month and I'm daydreaming of them right now. Should've ordered them a week ago so I wouldn't be out now. These dark chocolate bars are so delicious I can conjure up the taste and sensation right now because. . . now here's the heaven part of this daydream. . .they taste like Baby Ruth candy bars from when I would a youth!  Yum, yum, yum.<br /><br />Gotta love it, guilt free candy! But, wait, everyone, it is NOT guilt free if you make it an extra snack, but instead make it part of your meal planning day. The nutrition and calorie info is printed on each bar and if you buy them in the carton, then the info is even easier to read.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "Each of these three products has a number of reviews.  I don't have much to add to any of the individual reviews.  Coconut water is great, if you are in the market for a case of it you already know this.  But which of these three is the best?<br /><br />I went around town and found 5 boxes of each of the three brands (15 total) each, with no two boxes of a the same brand coming from the same supplier.  The goal was to get a wide range of product batches.  This I am happy to report was pointless.  All three brands produce an internally consistent product.<br /><br />I then ordered a 12 pack of all three brands from Amazon.  The only significant difference in packaging is that O.N.E. glues a little telescoping straw to each individual box, the other two brands do not.  If you are a straw person this is a feature if not this is just more trash, you decide.  The amount per container varies slightly by brand but given the price fluctuation on Amazon I don't consider the 0.1 Oz  differences an important factor.<br /><br />All three are made in Brazil, O.N.E. mentions that it is pasteurized the other two do not (nevertheless, I suspect all three are).<br /><br />On pure taste, at refrigerator temperature, I found <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CN7BMA\">Zico</a> to be the best (say 5/5), but only nominally better than <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UUWECC\">O.N.E.</a> (4.5/5), <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LL0R8I\">Vita</a> was a distant third (3/5).  Both Zico and O.N.E. taste almost exactly like drinking right from a fresh green coconut.  Vita, on the other hand, has a grape aftertaste which I did not like.  At room temperature the order remained the same; however, the differences in taste became more obvious: Zico (5/5), O.N.E. (4/5), Vita (2/5).  Obviously all of this is subjective.<br /><br />I observed the price of three on Amazon over the course of a month.  Zico (~$24) was consistently more expensive than the other two (~$18-21) which traded places as the least expensive.<br /><br />Considering the price and quality, O.N.E. is my choice and the brand to which I now subscribe.  I consider Zico an excellent, but over priced, product and Vita an inferior product.  If, however, I preferred my coconut water at room temperature I would give strong consideration to paying the extra money for Zico.  If I used my coconut water as a mixer I would buy which ever one is cheapest at the time.<br /><br />All three products are better than nothing (the previous option) and I am happy to see them on the market.\n",

Triple win.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of crystal light, with all the caffeine I drink I know I should be drinking more water, but can't get myself to crave the bland taste. Enter Crystal light. There are a ton of good flavors to choose from, but my criteria was as follows:<br /><br />1. A flavor not so extreme that I would get sick of it after a week. A mix of tart and sweet, neither one too strong.<br />2. I could purchase in bulk and not have to think about restocking for a while<br />3. Great price<br /><br />This product fit the bill perfectly. The lemonade is a burst of tart, but the raspberry brings it back down to a more neutral flavor. So whether you want lemonade or juice, the raspberry lemonade can do the trick.<br /><br />As for the packaging, the shipment came with 4 canisters that hold 8 extra-large packets. The packets are exactly double the size of the standard crystal light packets - so you're essentially getting 16 packets per canister. The directions advise 1 quart water per packet and since I tend to use CL in cups, water bottles, and glasses, I am able to use about half the packet each time I use (1 regular packet).<br /><br />Overall, this is a great buy and I will be purchasing again through Amazon.<br /><br />NOTE: It looks like Amazon increased the price of this product significantly. I see it now at $19.99. I purchased for $6.62. Obviously Amazon prices change constantly, so I would keep a look out for a deal before purchasing. I would personally just buy the cheapest one since they all essentially do the same thing anyway, and I have yet to come across an awful crystal light.\n",

Just because each individual treat was so tiny and there were so many of them in one bag...it would've lasted a lot longer...if my mischeivious pupppy didn't get into the bag when my husband and I were gone...Yes, he loved these treats SO much, maybe too much that he ATE the ENTIRE BAG!!!! I was really concerned at first when we found out he had eaten almost a full bag (I bought the 1 lb bag about 2 weeks ago, so it wasn't completed full but there were still A TON of left in the bag). But, I was a little bit relieved knowing at least this product was made out of all natural and high quality ingredients. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 start was although the treats were made out of all natural and high quality ingredients, the smell was AWEFUL! My husband wouldn't even reach into the bag to get the treats...and after I gave these treats to my puppy, I had to wash my hands to get the smell off. That was my only complain about this product, otherwise, AWESOME product! I didn't plan on purchasing another 1 pound bag that soon but since my pup ate em all, I'll have to buy it AGAIN!\n",

This is one of the few health bar that doesn't give you that sugar high and then nap time afterward.<br /><br />As a working individual that logs a lot of hours behind a monitor, sometime it is difficult to grab a meal when you are in the middle of something. So for the past few years, I've been stashing a collection of nutritional bar at my desk. Usually, that stash consist of items on sale from either Amazon or Vons. I've many different bars, from Clif Bar, Nature Valley's Granola Bar, to Balance Bar. None of them can compare to KIND bar. I've actually never heard about this company until a sale on Amazon, but due to great reviews. Which is why I want to put in my 2 cents as well.\n",

The Cheddar was good but you can tell it was a healthy version of this flavor chips. The rest of the flavors I would say taste as they normally do, nothing special or out of the typical range of those flavors.\n",

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about \"bowel tolerance\" or \"happy bowels\" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

      "Good, healthy meals on the go that don't taste like cardboard are hard to come by these days.  Most \"healthy\" alternatives, especially the gluten-free type, usually have no flavor or make one cringe when chewing.<br /><br />Barilla has alleviated much of this problem with their ready-to-go mezze penne microwavable meals.  When they say, \"ready in less than a minute,\" on the box they really meant it.  Within two minutes of pulling the packaging out of my cabinet I was ready to scarf it down. The meal takes one minute in the microwave as it has water that prepares the noodles while simultaneously warming up the sauce, which is in an independently sealed pouch.  Pretty straight forward similar to Easy Mac.<br /><br />The meal was somewhat tasty as I love spice and it had some hints of it, however, I found myself putting in some hot sauce just to 'spice' things up a bit (you'll pardon the pun).  You could also add you own meat but such preparation would kinda defeat the purpose of the \"less than 1-minute\" food boast.<br /><br />My only real gripe is the cost as they're hardly cost effective.  It is considerably cheaper to make you own and you can make them in larger quantities but, such is the problem with ANY quick meals.<br /><br />All in all, tasty and very easy on the go but the cost needs to come down first in order to truly be practical.\n",

A more sophisticated method is in use today, but in honor of Wilbur Scoville, the unit of measure is still called the Scoville.<br /><br />The capsaicin level in peppers can vary from plant to plant due to local environmental conditions. This means that a pepper's rating is an average measure.<br /><br />The hottest pepper on record is the Bhut Jolokia with a pungency of over 1 million Scoville Heat Units (1,001,304, to be exact).

My friend assured me that she hasn't had any problems with the hulls, so I went ahead and bought a tub. I've been putting them in and on everything, and I haven't noticed a single hull! I put them in smoothies, on salads, in baked goods, on oatmeal, in granola; super tasty. I will buy this again, it's a good deal.\n",

I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic.\n",

      "I have a very tall, lean, long-legged male cat. He doesn't eat much. I put out the finest wet food and he shows barely any interest. I buy expensive dry food to supplement his main meals. Eh, he could take or leave it. I even tried giving him high-end tuna from a can--the kind people eat--and he hardly nibbled at it. He just doesn't have much of an appetite, or so I thought. When I sprinkle a handful of these treats on a napkin, he furiously eats them all up. When I open the cabinet where I keep them, he comes running from wherever he is in the house. He seems to like all the flavors equally (chicken, beef, salmon - doesn't matter). Temptations is the only food I can count on his eating on a consistent basis. I could never train him or manipulate him with food before because nothing ever motivated him. These treats motivate him. If I need to calm him down for a brushing or a nail trimming, Temptations will work the magic. Thank you, Temptations.\n",

The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2\" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.<br /><br />What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.<br /><br />Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off.

I really think the fact that they only use the top 2 leaves and the bud of the plant must explain the big difference compared to other teas.  If you've been drinking the usual American grocery store teas (Lipton, Bigelow, etc.), you will notice a big difference.  At least I did.  I use one tea bag to make a tall travel mug of tea (even when I'm at home so it will stay hot), so I can't say if the bags make extra strong tea if you make it in a small mug as some other reviewers have commented.\n",

I am still mixing in 1 tsp of coffee or less to 1 full scoop of teeccino, for the taste,  at the same time I am getting used to the new taste. I also mix in with non-dairy milks - rice, coconut or almond - coconut works the best for me, although a brand matters. I highly recommend to follow the instruction on the package - makes all the difference for coffee addicts - to slow down the transition from real coffee to a substitute. A taste of teeccino is great on its own - great job of its maker, it just does not feel right for a coffee addict. Give yourself time for your taste buds to adjust, and you'll start enjoying the teeccino as well. Also experiment with a coffee maker and non-dairy milks.\n",

      "I had pretty high hopes for the Busy Bone. I have a large, active chewer (the kind of dog that has to have several bones to choose from all the time if you don't want her to chew up your bed frame). I was hoping that with the Busy Bone's 'long-lasting' promise, I might be able to just give her one of these and at least have time to wash the dishes. Why don't I describe what happened next...<br />I was in the kitchen washing the dishes. It had been about fifteen minutes since I'd given the dog the bone. Deeply absorbed in annoyance with myself for not rinsing said dishes, I was scrubbing vigorously when an awful sound met my ears: a terrible and hauntingly familiar crunching noise. The dog was eating my bed. So I go into the bedroom to scold her and even before I get a chance to look at the bed frame, I am struck by the mess she has caused. The Busy Bone somehow leaves little brown crumbles ALL over the floor. Too small and numerous to pick up by hand and too gushy for the vacuum cleaner to clean up, the oobleck has to be washed out of the carpet with a dish rag. And did I mention that they're expensive?<br />I will continue to stick with real bones that I purchase from the butcher. They're cheaper, they last longer, and they don't leave a terrible mess.\n",

There really are recognizably sized leaves in this bag.<br /><br />2. You can tell that the leaves are decent sized because the almost-clear nylon bag gives you a great view into them.<br /><br />3. They leave plenty of room for the leaves to expand in the bag. It's about 1/3 full, and when you steep the leaves, you can see that they expand and flatten out nicely.<br /><br />Of the two types of Revolution tea I've tried, White Tangerine Tea and Sweet Ginger Peach Tea, the Sweet Ginger Peach is my favorite.  However, I tend to like fruity herbal teas more than straight black / white / green teas.  I like to hand people a bag of the Sweet Ginger Peach and have them take a good whiff. Granted, a lot of teas are simply aromatic, but this tea isn't. It really does have the fruity taste of ginger and peach.

      "I found it least expensive from Amazon at about $8.50 for a box of 6 bowls via subscribe and save.  That may sound expensive (compared to 25 cent ramens and 50 cent cup noodles) but that is because crystal noodle uses a freeze dried process that I feel preserves much of the flavor of the flavor packet of mushrooms.  The noodles are also very thin with a silky smooth texture and easy to consume while absorbing the flavor of the soup.  The sodium level is high (due to MSG probably) so that is a plus for those who enjoy sodium (funny thing I love sodium but despise sweets).  Is this healthy for you?  I don't know about that.  But without regards to whether it is healthy, I deeply enjoy having this for lunch at work.  Easy to make, easy to eat, and simply delicious.  If you do not have access to boiling water, use hot enough water and let it cook for longer (i.e.instead of 3 minutes, let it cook for 7-8 minutes).  P.S. Do not forget to finish drinking the soup!  That is the best part!!<br /><br />NOV03,2011<br /><br />I just purchased another box.  The new cup shows NO MSG.  Also new cup is 1.90oz rather than the 1.98oz they advertise (it was 1.98oz previously and damn tasty but now not so much).  The flavor freeze dried packet is also smaller.  I am going to have to decrease this to 2 stars.  This is more in the I am disappointed lines (instead of increasing costs, they are just going to decrease content...call me a pessimist but I think the decrease in content is not to promote healthy eating but rather to boost bottom line).  Flavor is more bland now, just like any other instant noodle out there...nothing special anymore.\n",

      "When I first tasted this sauce, I figured the odds were good that I'd like it.  Heck, I'd probably like habenero-flavored shoe leather.<br /><br />What I didn't expect was that I'd like Tabanero this much more than other hab sauces I've known.  For starters, the heat is moderated, allowing the fruitiness of the habanero pepper variety to really shine through.  \"Moderated\" is, of course, relative - for those who find most of the major-brand ubiquitous bottled sauces unbearably hot to start with, be warned that Tabanero has a bit *more* kick.  For those who sip from skull-and-crossbones labeled bottles that contain little more than distilled capsaicin...well, I don't even get that whole preference:  all pain and no flavor.<br /><br />Tabanero is all flavor, from the peppers being the first and dominant ingredient of the sauce (vs. water in too many brands) to the avoidance of food coloring and cheap thickeners (again pretty common elsewhere.)  Carrot juice instead both thickens the sauce and deepens its bright orange hue, and the acidic kick provided by aggressive use of vinegar in many other brands is here replaced with more mellow onion and key lime juice.<br /><br />Agave as a sweetener seems appropriate considering the geographic origin of this product (which is the Mexican state of Tabasco) - it's a light sweetener that I myself find more inoffensive than tasty, but probably a good choice for that very reason.  This sauce doesn't need to guild the lily with cloying and potentially flavor-masking sugar.<br /><br />My husband, trying this sauce for the first time, muttered something about it \"not being spicy enough\" and then proceeded to douse his dinner with the stuff, abandoning his usual <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000GHNTA\">El Yucateco Red Chile Habanero Sauce, 4 oz.</a>, which was also on the table.  And just for fun, I'd left our family's favorite (non-Mexican) hot sauce - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZZM\">Huy Fong, Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, 28-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)</a>.  That, too, remained untouched.<br /><br />Of course the thing about the Sriracha - its pepper base is red jalapenos, which makes for a *very* different, if equally addictive flavor profile.  But I can grab a 28 ounce bottle of Sricha from my local Asian Grocer for less than I'll pay for the 8 oz bottle of this liquid hab sunshine.  As with many folks, it's the age-old struggle between \"what I love\" and \"what I can afford for everyday\".<br /><br />Still, Habanero-specific sauces don't run cheap, and I can't imagine preferring one of those better-known brands, now that I've tried Tabanero.  Currently it's distributed in Southern California stores (and a smattering of southeast locales, mostly restaurants.) I'd love to see this sauce gain national prominence, because it would seriously raise the bar for everybody else.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I did receive a complimentary sample of this product from the manufacturer.  But if I felt so-so about it, I'd give a so-so review.\n",

I still ate a bite and it was very soft and mealy.  I tried another bag and they were all that way.  Not chewy, no multiple flavors or meaty.  It instantly turned mealy and then kind of dissolves.  I started giving it to our dogs, they loved it, then my parents came over and my dad saw it on the counter.  He tried some and loved it.  eww.  He has dentures and said it was just the kind of jerky he was looking for.  SO.... IF you have dentures and want a beef jerky to try, maybe this one is for you!\n",

First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.

I drink this every single day at work, often using 4-5 packs a day. Fair warning: this 6-pack may not be that great of a deal, depending on where you live. I can get it at the supermarket for about $2.48 a box. To have this 6-pack work out to be a better bargain than buying local it would have to be 14 bucks per, or less. BUT, that has nothing to do with the quality of this product. The tea itself is great.\n",

In addition, the Mild definitely has some heat (not overly strong) to it, which I might understandably expect in the one labeled Hot but not one marked Mild. I'm a big fan of Penzey's spices but am such an Amazon fan that I thought I would try a new product in lieu of the one I had been buying--and it was a total mistake. The ingredient listing might have been in the listing though I truly didn't check it as I'm accustomed to a wide array of blends both from India and elsewhere that have a varying balance of cumin and other standard spices--but MUSTARD? So disappointing as the color was also unappealing but the flavor and aroma were just unacceptable. The heat would have been tolerable but not such a bizarre flavor profile for curry.

The lightness, of course, comes at a price and illy issimo cappuccino tastes as light as you would have expected it. It is made of medium-brew coffee, which is not that bad, but I prefer more full flavored varieties. This is a fairly tasty coffee-based energy drink, but it's not as impressive as illy issimo's espresso drinks.

It tastes fine and is good for hydration and electrolytes, though you could take regular purified water and add some minerals and lemon or vegetable juice for similar benefits. Since it comes in a plastic bottle you'll want to keep it cool so that heat doesn't make the water absorb plastic chemicals.

I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo.\n",

Some have commented on a slight difference in flavor, but for us, it was completely different, and disgusting.  We have switched to Carnation Instant Breakfast and at times, plain old Hershey's Syrup!  We used to buy three cans each of Chocolate and Malt Ovaltine, every few weeks, but we will not buy more until the recipe is changed back to the original.  This change was so very upsetting to our family.  My kids only liked Ovaltine in their milk.<br /><br />This change was unnecessary, uncalled-for and is ruining the brand name Ovaltine after so many generations of loyalty.

I will not go back to my old brand.  These refried beans taste like the pinto beans they are made with, and they have just enough onions, garlic, and other spices to complement the beans rather than overpower the flavor of the beans.  As well, they don't seem as \"heavy\" as other beans that I've eaten.  I will definitely buy these beans again.<br /><br />I was disappointed, though, that most of the cans were dented and damaged.  This doesn't seem to have affected the quality of the product, but it does seem odd that so many damaged cans were sent in one order.  It seems to me that the shipper may be at fault here and may be sending the dented cans because it might be easier to cast them off on the internet-order crowd--they aren't as likely to return them as a shopper in a store would be not to buy them without a discount.\n",

I bought 4 packs and am half-way through the last bag and can't wait to be done with this bland, bland, bland coffee. (I'm obviously too cheap just to dump it)!<br /><br />I also gave these beans a test in my espresso machine; forget about it! You will get zip in the way of \"crema\" from these beans (not that they are intended for espresso).

      "My 15 year old tortoiseshell, Sadie, has hyperthyroidism and requires 1/2 pill each morning. After trying liquid form, medicated treats and even pills by themselves, forget it! Sadie was having none of it and she was becoming increasingly stressed out.<br /><br />At the suggestion of our new vet, we tried Greenies Pill Pockets. They come in several flavors (salmon, tuna, chicken, etc.) and are shaped like little pockets, the consistency of soft clay. They may be purchased through your vet, or at anyplace like PetCo, since they are not a prescription item. (They may be ordered over the Internet as well for better pricing; however, our vet warned us to be sure to check out the expiry date on the package when it arrives).<br /><br />The trick is to hold the pill pocket in one hand and place the pill (or capsule) with the other hand into the pill pocket (without actually touching the pocket with that hand) to avoid cross-contamination with the medication smell. With the hand holding the pocket, close it up so it resembles a treat and give it to the cat.<br /><br />Since I have hypothyroidism, I say to my Sadie: \"Mommie's gonna take her special treat first, then it'll be Sadie's turn for her special treat!\" Sadie actually sits and watches me take my Synthroid, then prepare her \"special treat.\" I fuss her up and tell her what a good girl she is and make a show of it every morning. Sadie gets all excited and gobbles up her \"special treat\" without any problems anymore.<br /><br />It's a daily ritual that's become very special to both of us. On the weekends when I can sleep in a bit longer, or if I sleep through the alarm during the week, Sadie will actually jump on the bed and softly tap my face to wake me up - letting me know it's time for our special treat.

Once I came into the picture, I turned him on to the Sugar Free version.  He LOVED it.  Then, in seemed like \"all of a sudden\" the grocery stores quit carrying the cherry flavor.<br /><br />I did an internet search and found the Cherry Sugar Free Kool-Aid on Amazon.  Perfect shipping. Other reviews have mentioned the powder being chunky or hard to break up.  While we did experience that on our first shipment almost a year ago, we have since enountered it.<br /><br />I don't drink Cherry Kool-Aid.  Hubby is so happy and we've signed up for the recurring shipping.  Free shipping and a 15% discount on our order?  Thank you!<br /><br />Update - 12/29/2011 - BOOOOOO! Apparently Kool-Aid is no longer making this as Amazon just cancelled my recurring shipment.  Why on earth would they cancel something so amazing?\n",

      "Bordens Egg Nog is a long-time family favorite for the holidays. Rich and creamy, and noggy enough to satisfy a die-hard eggnog lover! Even though it comes in a can, it tastes remarkably fresh. I love a cup of eggnog with a slice of spicy, dark homemade fruitcake. However, eggnog is also a wonderful additon to many recipes like French toast, quick breads, cookies, cakes, and beverages. What a wonderful Christmas morning breakfast: eggnog French toast with maple syrup. Santa may just make a return visit!\n",

      "We bought this with the hope of preventing cats from getting out.  They are smart enough to bait the dog to come near the door and let them out or in as they wish.<br /><br />I think this door is overpriced.  It does not come with a battery or charger, and you really need 2 batteries so you can charge one while using the other.  We installed it into a door, so using the ac power cord is not a good option.  Also, our puppy chewed through the wire connecting our computer to the Internet the first week we got him, making us nervous about a power cord in his space.<br /><br />We got a 2nd puppy.  A few days later we found the cover of his collar transmitter in the yard.  I guess the two dogs played too roughly and the transmitter came apart?  The button battery from the inside was missing, and it was 5:30 pm.  We looked in the grass for it til it got dark but never found it.  Swallowing a button battery is a medical emergency, kind of like appendicitis, only it can affect any part of the GI tract.  So we had to take both dogs to the emergency vet to get x-rayed to see if either had eaten the battery.  No battery in either dog, thank goodness, but we spent a bit more than $250 for that information.  The collar transmitter should have a screw or something to hold it together better.<br /><br />I am currently writing this from my bedroom, and I hear the door opening and closing over and over.  A dog must be sitting too close.  Guess that means we will be charging the battery again in the am.  I'm annoyed by the sound, though it is not horribly loud.  I really wish we had gone with a heavy duty magnetic type door.\n",

However, I first tried the passion fruit flavored Zico and thought, this doesn't taste like coconuts at all! I loved the taste and soon got addicted to how good I felt post workouts. I tried the other mango flavor, and liked it too, so thought I'd venture to the natural coconut one. To my surprise, it wasn't what I remembered coconuts tasted like, in fact, it was more refreshing than the other flavors!<br />I love the new bottle Zico has come out with, it makes drinking and cooling Zico so much easier. The Lime and Pomberry additions are amazing! The bottles make traveling with it easier, and now, I don't have to drink in one sitting.<br />Best time to drink a Zico though is after a hard night of partying. I don't know what it is, but after a night of drinking, I always reach for a Zico and the next morning, its as if nothing happened the night before. I'm a firm believer in the natural remedies of coconuts now, post workout, post drinking, post anything where you exert energy. I still won't eat a real coconut, but I will drink a Zico. I've tried the other brands out there and cannot stomach it, but for some reason, love Zico.\n",

They are not overly sweet either; the first ingredient listed is apple puree concentrate.  The rest of the ingredient list is long, but amazingly, 99 percent of the ingredients are recognizable and pronounceable.  What I did not like is that when biting into the bar, it tended to crumble (not good at the computer); I solved this by just cutting up the bar into pieces.  The other thing is that for a snack, I personally would not pay more than 75 cents apiece for these.\n",

      "I have not always been a coffee drinker but have recently begun to enjoy a cup or two per day. Since my son is the only other person her that drinks coffee and he usually drinks the entire pot by himself, I tend to use the store brand or Maxwell House single serve coffee that is used in the same manner as a tea bag. I am not certain that is the intended use for the Marley single serve coffee pods. I don't have a single serve coffee machine although at times I vacillate about buying one, so I'm not sure what the pods for the machines that use them look like. The Marley coffee pods may be intended for use in one of these machines; however the package and the item page do not specify how they are to be used other than single serve. I brewed them in the same way I brew my usual coffee by heating the water in an electric kettle and letting it steep in the cup until I think it has brewed long enough. It seemed to work just fine.<br /><br />As far as the taste, I enjoyed my coffee. It had a somewhat bitter smell but I was happy to find that it did not have a bitter taste. In fact it was fairly smooth tasting. My son also tried a cup and said it was okay. He likes his coffee so strong that most other people can't drink it so I wouldn't go by his opinion. He did mention that he thought it was too expensive. I guess it would be expensive for someone who drinks as much coffee as he drinks. He could finish a box in a couple of days.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />1. This coffee is very tasty and perfect for those who only want one cup at a time.<br />2. This coffee is a good choice for those who prefer organically grown, fair trade coffee.<br />3. This coffee also supports the Kicks for Cause Foundation with partial proceeds going toward youth soccer programs.<br />4. I doubt that I will purchase any of this coffee but that is because I am not a coffee purist and tend to be satisfied with less expensive blends.\n",

Its perfect as is, just the right hint of mint and something else that keeps me from needing sweetener or having a bitter aftertaste.

I LOVE ice cream but I'm also trying to lose weight and a serving of regular ice cream just doesn't get it. I will admit, the first time I tried it, I wasn't thrilled. It was icy and the flavor didn't do much for me. Then I read a review that said you should let it sit at room temp for a while so that it softens some. OMG!!! What a difference!!! Creamy, creamy, creamy. All of the icyness goes away and it's so smooth and creamy I was amazed. I've gone through 3 of the pints now and I like it more each time I eat it. Maybe it's an acquired taste or maybe it's that going in I KNEW it wasn't going to taste like real ice cream (really, how could it?) but I was looking more for the texture and coldness of ice cream, not necessarily the flavor. One thing I do if I want it a little sweeter is I sprinkle a couple of teaspoons of PB2 (powdered peanut butter - GREAT STUFF!!!! and it's sold on Amazon) on the top and mix it in. It sweetens it just enough and it only adds about 20 calories and lots of PB flavor so it's worth it. I could also never eat a whole pint of this at one time. After eating about a 1/3 of the pint I feel stuffed. I'll definitely be buying this again!!!\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "Really like the idea of a roller-ball to give treats, especially as rewards when training (skateboard, leash walking and close commands).  The dispenser is similar to a roll-on deodorant design.  Lickety Stik is a healthy all natural (according to the ads) liquid containing vitamins and low in calories in several flavors. The dispenser contains over 500 licks.  A no mess way to give rewards plus it carries the made in the USA with all-natural ingredients.  My English Bulldog puppy loves the stuff (liver flavor); however, it also comes in chicken and bacon flavors. Following  is a list for those who read the ingredients,  1)natural liver flavors, (2) cultured milk, (3) lecithin, (4) mixed tocopherols (natural preservative- a source of vitamin E), (5) scorbyl palmitate (source of vitamin C), (6) rosemary extract, (7) green tea extract.  A caution about dogs allergic to chicken - they should not be licking this stuff. Unlike most treats, the shelf life is 18 months and \"best\" licked by date is stamped on the bottom of the roll-on dispenser. The description indicates the Lickety Stik formula contains antimicrobial agents - basically no germ transfer. The stuff does not have to be refrigerated.  Naturally, you must shake the dispenser often.  Will be ordering the Lickety Stik 3 pack with all flavors from Amazon.  \"Reilly\" recommends the treat!\n",

The sauce contains no cocoa butter, and its unspecified dairy flavors are way down the list of ingredients.<br /><br />in short, this sauce gives my coffee drinks, hot chocolate, and desserts a sweet and creamy consistency with a flavor similar to vanilla or, more accurately, doughnut or pastry frosting.<br /><br />The good news: Unlike real white chocolate, this is fat-free, it's marginally lower in calories, and it pours easily.<br /><br />For a more authentic white-chocolate sauce -- including the saturated fat and additional calories -- try Fontana White Chocolate Mocha Sauce. It contains all the key ingredients of real white chocolate; it's Starbucks' choice for the coffee chain's white-chocolate drinks; and (contrary to the sauce's name) it does NOT contain \"mocha\" (coffee).<br /><br />If you buy Ghirardelli's sauce in the 64-ounce bottle, be sure to pay less than $20 for it.

Yes, the texture may seem a bit off-putting for some.  But for someone like me who can't eat normal pasta, these truly are a miracle noodle.  The garlic flavor in particular gives a nice mild taste to the noodle.  If you put a bit of Earth Balance (or butter, etc) on them, the salt helps to balance the flavor.  The texture is kind of chewy, but I would not compare it to a jellyfish like a previous reviewer!  I have tried seaweed noodles before, and THOSE taste and have texture like jellyfish.  If you are simply trying to low-carb diet, I don't know that I would recommend these.  Or, if you are gluten-free only, I don't know that I would recommend these.  However, I am gluten-intolerant and pre-diabetic, and I have had to stop eating grains entirely, and these are the only \"noodle\" I can eat.

Seems stores have limited shelf space and rarely carry \"specialty\" items like the Double Bergamot Earl Grey.  If you like Earl Grey, you will adore the Earl with Double Bergamot.  Very distinctive flavor.  Unique!  Thankfully Amazon sells the six-pack of this special tea, which we get on automatic delivery so we never run out.  Priced better than the local stores.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "This is an outstanding product.<br />I have 2 cats, and I am very conscious about what I feed them. They are like my children, and I only want to feed them the best. I heard about Ellen DeGeneres' company, Halo, and their products for pets. I respect Ellen and her deep love of animals. The treats are all natural, just freeze dried pure white chicken meat. I bought them, and gave each of my cats a small piece, and WOW, you would have thought it was catnip. They both started purring and rubbing up against me for more.<br />Now, it is a nightly treat. At around 9:30, they both let me know they want their chicken, and I feel happy knowing I'm giving them something safe, and healthy.<br />I will admit that they are expensive. It is not a very big jar, but I break apart the large pieces, and give them each 2 small treat size pieces a night, so the jar lasts a long time. Once you open them, they do have to be stored in the refidge. The only problem that I have is that everytime I open my refidge, one of my cats tries to con me into giving her an extra treat. This rarely happens, but you have to be careful not to shut the door on a tail.<br />I have recommended this product to several friends, all of whom have had the same result with their cats.<br />*****\n",

And light and fluffy.  I'm pretty sure he was following the recipe right on the container.  He got spoiled with great food in his young adult life, and he's a picky eater.  So if he says something tastes good, then that's really saying something.

The consistancy is also quite nice, there is a crunch to them, but the chips arent so hard as if you're chewing glass or some foreign matter; eating these won't make sensitive teeth hurt. They also come in a four ounce bag; enough to satisfy but not make you feel bloated and easy to count calories if you care about such things.

While that might not seem like much, all you need is a dot of this thick gel paste at the end of a toothpick to color large amounts of material.

If you choose the subscribe and save option the price cannot be beat anywhere.  The beef and lamb formula is the favorite of the Instinct flavors amongst my three dogs.  While not a cheap food, you get what you pay for.  I've been feeding Nature's Variety and admittedly a few other high quality brands for years.  First off, the amount to feed listed on the bag, at least for my adult dogs (10, 6 and 5 years old) is much lower than recommended.  My dogs generally get 3/4 cup twice a day, with the 10 year old getting a bit less.  A nice perk is very, very small stool production (gross I know) but if you have multiple dogs it's nice to have small \"packages\" to pick up in the yard.  (If you fed supermarket brands you'd be scooping all day- I know as I have a pet related business.) Kibble size will work for any size dog- big or small.  Perhaps most importantly, I truly believe your dogs will be healthier and live longer on Instinct foods.  My 10.5 year old Merlin is just starting to show signs of aging.  I adopted him as a scroungry rescue at age 3, so he didn't have the best start in life.  It's amazing what a great diet can do for a dog.

The flavor of the coffee is good but, there is not as much creama as the Nespresso capsules.  With the new lower prices, these are a good alternative to Nespresso, but they are a compromise.  If you want the best flavor and creama, stick with Nespresso but, if you want a cheaper, almost as good altrnative, give them a try.  I really wish they would package several varieties in one \"intoductory\" package so I could try five varieties without having to buy five fifferent five packs of the same variety.  The descriptions don't give much of a clue as to how the coffe will taste and how strong it is.  If you purchase a five pack and aren't fond of the flavor or intensity, you have a lot of coffee you may not like.  I may try these again although, for now, I'm going to stay with the tried and true (and expensive) Nespresso brand.  Maybe the competition will slow down the frequent price increases from Nespresso.<br />UPDATE:  Prices have come down dramatically on these.  Still not as good as Nespresso originals, but Nespresso's customer service stinks so bad and their prices so high, I'm done buying from them.  These are close and environmentally much friendlier.\n",

      "A \"HELPFUL\" IDEA - HAVE A CASE OF COKE AND A SMILE\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "These new fridge packs do make it easy to just slide the pack right into the fridge and voila, COLD DIET COKE FAST! For an adult household this is an ideal convenience and other reviewers have very amply described this new feature. However, the downside to this is simple, it encourages children to pick a soft drink over milk, juice, gatorade or water. Which is why, in part, the marketers came up with this \"helpful\" idea. I noticed when I bought 8 of these packs on sale, they were gone in just a couple of days instead of a couple of weeks and all I could think was, \"AT LEAST THERE WASN'T A WHOLE LOT OF SUGAR IN IT\". Having said that, there is much to recommend Diet Coke and I have consumed it since it was introduced in 1982.<br /><br />The best thing about Diet Coke is basically the best thing about Diet Pepsi, you can find it anywhere and everywhere and it is always basically the same product. To a consumer that means one may safely buy and consume this hermetically sealed product with the reasonable expectation of not getting sick from the local water. This is the advantage of the can over the fountain. Canned \"Diet Coke\" also will not go flat as fast as a two liter or even a twenty-ounce bottle. Now, all the hermetically sealed products [cans and bottles] have expiration dates on each sealed container, further insuring the safety and freshness of this universal product.<br /><br />As far as contents go, the exact ingredients are on the can. However, unlike Pepsi's informative website where I found the milligram amounts for all ingredients per 8-ounce serving, Coke's website [www.cocacola.com] dealt more with the history and lore of Coke products. Where Pepsi's site clearly stated exactly what was in the can, I can only assume from the list of ingredients on the can of Diet Coke, which is an almost exact match of Diet Pepsi's, that one will find roughly the same amounts of caffeine and sodium in Diet Coke as Diet Pepsi. At Pepsi's website we quickly see, that there are 30 mg. of sodium and 24 mg. of caffeine per 8-oz. serving. A 12-ounce can = 1.5 servings or 45 mg. of sodium and 36 mg. of caffeine. The exact amounts of these ingredients are important if you have family members or guests with high blood pressure [sodium] or young children prone to hyperactivity [caffeine]. It is important to remember that fountain drinks are reconstituted where they are sold and no bottler [Coke or Pepsi] guarantees the exact amounts of caffeine or salt or anything for that matter in the drink, or the purity of the water used in reconstituting the fountain product -- a great argument for cans and bottles!<br /><br />As far as which brand is best, some think Diet Pepsi goes flat quicker than Diet Coke. Maybe, however, the smallness of a 12-ounce container would negate any difference if it exists since it is quickly consumed. As for myself, I rarely drink carbonated beverages, but when I am on the road with the kids and we all need to rehydrate, I know that canned Diet Coke [or Diet Pepsi] is safe and effective and most of all available wherever we might be.<br /><br />[PS- I am not affiliated with Coca-Cola, Pepsi or any other product]\n",

In particular, I have one with pancreatic insufficiency, requiring a low fat content, and a little fellow who has had a bout with gastroenteritis, so needed a food with a different protein source than chicken.  Both are healthy and happy with the Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.<br />The only drawback, and it does not concern the food itself, is that Amazon uses FedEx for their delivery.  Apparently, when there is a holiday on a weekend, FedEx home delivery takes extra weekdays off.  Consequently my order arrived after my kids ran out of the food they needed.  It took 4 1/2 days for FedEx to get the parcel from the Columbus, Oh area to central West Virginia.  UPS was delivering while FedEx was still holding up my shipment, as my UPS driver passed here the day before my dog food arrived.  I have spoken to Amazon corporate headquarters about the fact that it appears UPS can get the job done more efficiently.  Perhaps a UPS option is in order for those customers who would rather not use FedUP...oops..I mean FedEx.  Hey, weren't these the guys that were hurling Christmas packages out of their trucks?\n",

The pink powder smells strawberry-ey at first (sorry -- I'm much better at book reviews than these food reviews!), and the color once mixed with water is a nice deep pink. The granules are big and take some stirring to dissolve, which the package does indicate.<br /><br />Amid the fruity and honey taste (and smell of honey) it's hard to detect any tea flavor. I picked up a little blueberry as I continued drinking it the first time. Could I tell that it contains green tea rather than black tea or any other kind of tea?

I have to say it has worked wonders for my dog.  Her regular itching, diarrhea, etc. occurrences that the vet could never figure out, and were just treated with various antibiotics,  were essentially cured with this food.  I also use the same formula for her treats as well.  That's it, no other ingredient types.  I'm very satisfied so far.  My only complaint is no local stores stock the smaller bite sin the larger bags.<br /><br />Just a note: I recommend this size even for 30-40 lb dogs.  The larger pieces are VERY hard and were a bit difficult for my dog to chew.<br /><br />The only con to this formula is that your dog WILL be going #2 more often.  It is sweet potato after all.  Mine went from typically twice, but no more, to guaranteed three times a day.  However her allergies are under control and she is happy eating the food so that is all that matters to me.\n",

      "Havista's \"3-4cm\" dried shiitakes have a slightly smaller average diameter than Havista's \"3-5cm\" dried shiitakes.  The big picture is that there wasn't much difference between \"3-4cm\" and \"3-5cm.\"  I counted about half as many 5.0cm to 5.5cm diameter dried shiitakes in this product as I found in Havista's \"3-5cm\" dried shiitake product.  The tiny 2.5cm to 3.0cm dried shiitakes were slightly more numerous in this product than Havista's \"3-5cm\" product.  Apparently, Havista believes that kilogram for kilogram, their tiny shiitakes are worth slightly more than their larger shiitakes.  Interestingly, the Japanese believe just the opposite.  In Japan, the largest shiitakes are called, \"donko,\" and separated from the rest to be sold at a higher price per kilogram than the rest.  The quality of these dried shiitakes is about as good as any other brand of dried shiitakes.  About 1 mushroom in 30 to 50 might be defective (taste sour or look decomposed).  That's not worse than other brands.  These dried shiitakes will fully occupy just slightly less than 5 1/2 one-gallon plastic jars.  Product of China.<br />Caution:  Havista's dried shiitakes are extremely rich in vitamin D2.  Without even contacting Havista, I can tell that these shiitakes received plenty of sunshine where they were farmed.  I get hypercalciuria (calcium sand in my urine) after eating only two-thirds of the dried shiitakes in a 1-gallon plastic jar.  Hypercalciuria is a symptom of hypervitaminosis D (vitamin D overdose).\n",

      "OK, so I had no illusions that this product was somehow organic & chemical free considering that it's made by Unilever (owner of Alberto Culver, Helene Curtis, Faberge', etc.) and costs less than 5 bucks. That being said, I had great results with this product. I used it as a \"hot oil\" treatment, and also to tame flyaways after shampooing (a few drops will do for this purpose).There are NO instructions about how to use the product, however. Having worked in the beauty field, I didn't have an issue with this. It's a light oil (yes, it's mineral oil....that's what less expensive hair products like this are made of) but there are also some fairly \"nutritious\" oils added in too. My wavy 'post hypothyroid' hair likes this product, even though I believe it's more intended for ethnic hair. If you have a dry, itchy scalp or dry, frizzy flyaway hair this product can help as long as it's used properly. Think of it like the old fashioned VO5 (brilliantine) in a bottle, rather than trying to use it like a conditioner. I also use an Argan oil hair product, and this product is very similar, yet at 1/4th the cost.<br /><br />The scent is \"just right\" a lightly fruity fragrance, which I prefer over flowery perfume-y scents most common in hair care products. If you can keep your expectations in alignment with reality, this product is...after all, less than $5 per bottle...I feel that you'll be satisfied. If not, you will be disappointed. If you need a totally organic product that does something similar, I'd opt for pure coconut oil instead (with essential oil added for fragrance if need be). Mineral oil can cause acne in individuals prone to it, so I'd keep this oil off your face (especially around the hairline where blemishes can develop) if that is the case. You can also wash your face after applying if you happen to spill.<br /><br />If your hair is parched (oil dry), brittle, dull (no shine), or heat damaged this product is for you.

      "i absolutely LOVE this brand! i tried the chicken one and my kittens adored it, but we traveled steadily in june so i couldn't really get deliveries from amazon like i needed. i supplemented with petco's soulistic food because i read that weruva is contracted to make that brand. my kitties really dig it, too. but here's the difference between the two: with weruva, they eat a lot less and bulk up more. 2 cans a day for both of my 5 mo. old kitties is enough for them. with soulistic, they cannot stop eating it and one of my kitties still has a very lithe body. SO, i'm back to weruva - mack and jack this time - and i mix in SOLID GOLD SEAMEAL nutritional supplement that i purchase here. i mix extra water with the seameal and mix it in the food (about 3/4 cup) because we are in the desert and although we have ac, it is still 100+ outside.<br /><br />i bought a 6lb bag of dry salmon halo for them this go-around and they are so used to not having an dry food at all so their bodies don't like it very well. after half of this case of weruva is gone, i will initiate them into an all raw diet. i am also going to put soil in their litter box instead of all this other stuff (even though i am very happy with my KITTEN ATTRACT litter).\n",

      "Fabulous GF Banana Bread Mix -- Easy & Tasty!\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "As I'm sure my fellow gluten-free peeps know, it is difficult to use a boxed baking product without going at least 80% off box to make it taste any good. Usually I have to add spices -- gluten-free vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, syrups and so forth. Even so, the texture is usually still wrong even if I get the taste correct.<br /><br />Despite having forgotten how much effort goes into preparing an item to be baked, this impulse purchase in a local supermarket proved to be a very good decision. What a fabulous product! From the start of pouring the mix, it smelled so good. Adding the mashed bananas, water, and eggs made it smell like... well, it smelled like banana bread. Real banana bread. Oh, the anticipation!<br /><br />I was obviously very excited to see the finished product 60-70 minutes later and was not disappointed. It was perfect! This banana bread looks like banana bread, smells like banana bread, feels like banana bread and tastes like banana bread. If you didn't know it was gluten-free, you wouldn't know it was gluten-free. Apart from my own newfound love, rave reviews were received from my daughter, mother, and not gluten-free partner and father. (Those last two are a sign of true greatness in a boxed mix; given their ability to eat actual bread, they are usually only possible to please with a mix when I doctor it beyond recognition from its original state.)<br /><br />My only apologies go to my parents with whom I was a little stingy and the vegetarian friends who came over when I could have offered a slice but didn't because it's mine all mine (and my daughter's).<br /><br />The price on this mix on Simply Organic's own website is $4.99 (sometimes but rarely on sale for $3.99), more than I paid on sale at my local Shaw's. That's a better price -- but as usual the price checking win goes to Amazon, who offer a pack of three boxes for $12.90 (works out to $4.30 a box) as a one-off and at the low low price of $10.96 (works out to $3.65) with Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />I recommend serving with strawberries and heavy whipped cream, which is quite possibly the first time I've basically agreed with a serving suggestion on the box as well.\n",

      "BRS is neither organic, safe for diabetics, nor does it enter the bloodstream slower than other sweeteners.<br /><br />BRS is an entirely man-made food which exists no where in nature. It is made by harvesting enzymes from bacteria, mixing them with ground rice flour, and cooking the mix to simulate the action of salivary and pancreatic amylase. This is EXACTLY the procedure used in laboratories to study the digestion of polysaccharides.<br /><br />The result of this process is a concoction which consists of large amounts (~50%) of maltose and glucose, with a glycemic index of 105 and 100 respectively. Simply ingesting a teaspoon of this stuff will make your face flush with a sugar rush.<br /><br />Under no circumstances should BRS be taken by anyone with diabetes.

      "A must have if you are looking for an alternative to a raw food diet.  Both of my pugs LOVE IT!  It is a little pricey, but you only use a tiny scoop for each portion for a small dog. WORD OF CAUTION: after using ZiwiPeak for several months, I noticed my dogs were gaining A LOT of weight.  You really have to stick to the manufacturers directions.  This is dehydrated food and a little goes a long way. I love too that they use ranch raised animals with no hormones or antibiotics or fresh fish not from farms.<br /><br />From the Raw Food Diet to ZiwiPeak:<br />After much research and debate with both my husband and my veterinarian, I decided to try a raw food diet.  Well, the raw meat was just nasty and my pug would go for several days without eating.  Proponents of the raw food diet say this is normal because the raw meat/bones took longer to digest, but truly, my dog just seemed ravenous.  Normally she was very polite when we ate, now she was begging and even jumping up trying to get food off of the table.  I just couldn't take any more.  Yes, her teeth were gorgeous and her digestion seemed better, but the poor dog seemed very unhappy with her food.  We tried to the frozen food that you thaw out and that worked okay for a while, a nice treat now and then...but then we found ZiwiPeak!\n",

      "Baking gluten free is not easy, especially when trying to make your own flour blends. This mix is awesome because everything is mixed and ready to go. It really can be an all-purpose baking blend. The mix comes with a bunch of recipes on the back. The pancakes are awesome, but make sure to let the batter sit for a bit before using, it seems to make them come out extra fluffy. I almost cried when I ate these, tears of joy of course. My family says they taste no different and even taste better than regular pancake mix. Pamelas Bread Mix is wonderful too. Be mindful of the climate you live in when using Pamelas mixes when using yeast. I live in warm, humid Florida at a very low elevation, so when pamelas recipe says to let the bread batter sit for an hour to rise, I usually cut that time in half so I don't over proof the batter. Now I heard if you live at high elevations it's better to double that rise time. If your new to gluten free baking remember that when you bake bread it is normal for the consistency to be more like cake batter than like the stiff dough you would get when using white flour. Also, it is wise to make these recipes in the oven, you will have more control over the outcome than if you used a bread machine. Pamelas bread mix makes great artisan style breads, they won't be as fluffy as the Wonder bread you once enjoyed, but they sure do taste amazing.\n",

Apparently rising prices are forcing the manufacturer to put smaller amounts in the bag, but this is foolish since if anyone reads product labels it is the people that buy organic foods.  The manufacturer should wise up and just raise their price to reflect the increase rather than skimp on the bag size. Organic food consumers are willing to pay more for a premium product, but get upset when the company or marketer does not deliver on what they say they are going to deliver on. As for Amazon.com, I can only think that this is an honest mistake and that they did not update their product description. But, for a company that specializes in the latest and greatest computer tech, this is falling short of the mark.  To sum up, this is still a good product, but both the manufacturer and the seller need to get it right.\n",

I had never had wasabi before, but I have like many of the other \"Bold\" flavors Blue Diamond makes (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Habanero BBQ) so I decided to give them a try.  The flavor is definitely bold.  It reminds me of the horseradish flavor that is common in many deli mustards.  It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the \"soy\" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.  Combine that with almonds being one of the healthier snack options, and you've good a good treat.  Much like the other flavors, the bold flavor makes moderation fairly easy as I could not imagine going overboard on these.  Enjoy!\n",

Regarding the shipping costs, which some reviews had mentioned, they can be minimized by ordering multiple units together; you can have 4 shipped for the same shipping cost as 1. I have also read in other reviews that this kimchi is not very spicy but, to me, it seems about what I would expect. It has the normal amount of chili and the amounts of other spices vary. Regarding the packaging, the plastic bags used are a convenient size for shippment and storage but are not resealable; you will need to repackage whatever you don't use immediately from each bag you open.<br />I just hope this product remains available; I would like to keep some around for snacking or adding to meals.\n",

My vet advises slowly transitioning over to a new food, blending it in the old, and taking 1-2 weeks before the new food fully replaces the old. Completely changing the food can have a bad effect on some dogs with sensitive stomachs.\n",

They have reduced the juice, but added sugar and sodium and increased the calories.  The result is a terrible-tasting beverage that is NOT what is described on their web site.  This is a classic case of bait and switch.  Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink.  What a slap in the face to their customers.  It reminds me of the New Coke disaster a few years back.  At least Coca Cola admitted their mistake and went back to their classic formula.  Will Rockstar be that smart?

I decided to switch him to a grain free diet and found Urban Wolf. My dog has been seizure-free for quite some time now,(he just turned 11.) I do recommend that you give your dog a vitamin supplement, such as Pet Tabs. (By the way, he gets a double-dose of the Pet Tabs and it has greatly reduced his itching to the point where he's no longer on steroids.) I have also tried the doggie burgers from the pet store.

I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.\n",

      "Just had my first cup of this coffee.  It is strong, just how I like it, and has a nice aroma.  Because this is micro-ground it comes through the brewer much faster than the regular K-Cups.  I am not a coffee snob but do enjoy a good strong cup in the morning to get my motor running, this fits the bill just fine.  The price makes it a deal breaker, I just ordered more to add to my collection of different varieties of coffee.  I am well satisfied and hope you will be too.<br />____UPDATE from my original review.  After using this for several weeks, I will have to agree that this is not up to snuff with regular K-Cups---I don't think it's as bad as some think but is not as good as the regular ground coffee.  Some people drink instant coffee and have no problem with it and others just don't like it.  This will wake you up in the morning, but does lack the flavor of the regular ground varieties.\n",

      "Even though I had been writing reviews mostly on my favorite types of escape novels, I was sparked by Amazon's enthusiasm, to take part in the grocery store and gourmet food expansions here.  My first purchase (of products beyond books) included a grain called QUINOA (Keenwa).<br /><br />The product arrived in very good order and within perfect timing.<br /><br />In that maiden purchase I also added Lavender Oil  4 oz.  EssOil and NOW Foods, Clove Oil  4 oz to my shopping cart, along with powdered cloves, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YV7ZAI\">McCormick Cloves, Ground, 16 Ounce Unit</a>, and lavender teaThe Tao Of Tea Herbal Tea Lavender, 100% Organic, 2.0 Ounce Tin (Pack of 3).  See my Listmania on Essential Oils (which indicates which items I've reviewed) for info on the values and uses of lavender and cloves, available from various vendors here.<br /><br />I consider Quinoa to be the most valuable food available on the planet, a food which meets my standards for luxury gourmet in flavor (and culinary versatility), in addition to being baseline healthy with full spectrum nourishment.<br /><br />If I had to be limited to only 4 items or food groups (in addition to water, of course) to eat or drink, those would be Quinoa, Coffee, Dairy Products, and a variety of greens, spices, & nuts.  Yeah, okay, dairy products; and greens, spices, & nuts may be considered more than 2 items, but, for me they're two categories.<br /><br />I'm not a vegetarian because I love meat, chicken, and fish, but if I'm working with limitations, I'm making do with the most basic of basics, while still having enough food items to concoct satisfying flavor (yeah, yeah, and nutrition, too, though according to my beliefs, \"nutrition\" dims and deteriorates, unless it's in the living presence of \"yummy.\").<br /><br />Quinoa, I believe, would take care of all (or at least many) basic nutritional needs.<br /><br />The way I simplify my use and preparation of Quinoa is to think of it either as rice or oatmeal, and then to \"gourmet it\" accordingly.<br /><br />-- As \"rice\" I add savory herbs like parsley, basil, marjoram, garlic, onions, etc.  Actually, most types of herb concoctions or side foods which could be blended with pasta would also work with Quinoa.  Think of what Lidia's Italian Table does with \"noodle heaven\"; then substitute Quinoa for pasta (I like pasta too, of course).<br /><br />-- As \"oatmeal\" I add sweet or rich ingredients like fruit (including raisin and date types), brown sugar, molasses, maple, cream, that type of thing.<br /><br />As far as cooking instructions, to me they're basically the same as rice:<br /><br />-- Add water or liquid in a 2 to 1 ratio.  2 cups liquid (water, broth, vegetable, or fruit juices) to 1 cup Quinoa (Note that some brands vary this ratio slightly; check their instructions on the product package).<br /><br />-- Instructions are given on the bag for boiling the water then adding the Quinoa, covering the pot, and simmering for 12 15 minutes.<br /><br />-- I've also successfully prepared Quinoa in the microwave.  You can heat the water to boil in a bowl (use a large one with lots of room above the grain and water to avoid the mess of boiling over) then add Quinoa, cover, and cook.  Depending on power levels and volume of food, a microwave sometimes cooks 4 times faster than \"outside the waves\" cooking.  As an example of time variance with larger amounts of food: 1 potato cooks (on average) in 4 - 8 minutes, 2 potatoes require double that, or 8  16 minutes.<br /><br />-- For a single serving cooked quickly in the microwave, I might use 1/4 cup Quinoa with 2/4 (Â½) cup liquid.<br /><br />I have actually simplified the process for myself by placing those single serving amounts (Quinoa and water in a bowl) in the microwave, and cooking it on high, maybe 3 minutes, till the liquid bubbles.  Then I cover the bowl with a plate lid; zap it for another minute or half, then let it steep in the microwave, without opening it, for another few minutes.  (Since microwave ovens and tastes for texture differ, you'll have to experiment with your own microwave processes to get results which work for you, or just use the sauce pan method described on the bag.)<br /><br />In the microwave, Quinoa seems to cook easier than rice.<br /><br />But, I also cook rice in the microwave in a similar method.  I don't use minute rice, since my microwave method works easily and fairly quickly, and if I cook it in a serving bowl with a plate lid I can just place it on the table for family style digging in.<br /><br />I love the nutty, barley flavor of Quinoa.  Thankfully, so does my husband!<br /><br />Recently, Alter Eco Fair Trade, Arrowhead Mills, Berry Farm, Eden, Now Foods, and Angelina's have been added to my list of purveyors of Quinoa.<br /><br />In the past I've purchased Quinoa from Bob's Red Mill, and White Mountain Farms in Colorado, in the San Juan mountain area (have always been satisfied with those sellers, when/if the products are available on Amazon).  Having used many different Now Foods products, I'm also very confident in ordering their Quinoa as well.<br /><br />The reviews on Quinoa Red were helpful. In addition to the most common golden grain, I've only seen black Quinoa, which is also appealing, and is reportedly the oldest variety. Well, actually all the reviews I've read on Quinoa have offered something of value to the info I've already gathered.<br /><br />*** Though I would happily purchase any of the available Quinoa offerings on Amazon, currently I'm favoring ALTER ECO FAIR TRADE for my personal use. The extra details of info on the Alter Eco Fair Trade buying pages were appreciated very much, and I feel that this product is very close to what the original seeds were intended to be.***<br /><br />(I used to sell Quinoa in my CITY CHEF kitchen store, which is no longer open; I spend all my time writing now, with a little cooking on the side.)<br /><br />Quinoa has an interesting history, including the development of a saponin coating on the grain:<br /><br />-- The genetics in the Quinoa seeds, after eons and ages of growing, had developed the saponin coating as a very effective protection against insects and burrowing varmints, like worms or parasites.<br /><br />-- Knowing what saponin is and does, I began a habit of saving some of the water used to rinse Quinoa for watering my plants, or pouring on the ground where I might want to discourage insects.<br /><br />-- Once the saponin is removed, I'm not sure how long the \"naked\" grains will be able to protect themselves again parasitic invasions.  Certainly, Quinoa (being a very strong, wise old grain with high integrity, for many reasons) would be able to do so longer than other similar, eon's younger food offerings.  I'm not concerned about this, and will usually order either pre washed grain or saponin coated, whichever is readily available.<br /><br />Quinoa grows only above a 7,000 foot elevation and requires a certain growing climate, which can be found only in certain areas of the world.  Some parts of the Rocky Mountains are one of those areas, not tested until fairly recently (in terms of the eons and ages associated with this ancient grain from the Incas).<br /><br />Interesting stories about Quinoa's long history are bountiful, but I won't get into those.  A large assortment of books and pamphlets are available to read on it, and of course, many are offered here on Amazon.<br /><br />I remain ever thankful for magical foods (which are both gourmet and healthy in quality), especially in our era of being told by some authorities that we need to remove the life, magic, wholeness, and flavor out of most everything.  For the sake of \"health\"?<br /><br />Here's an interesting question to ponder:<br /><br />Why and how, for a while (eons), did we lose Quinoa seeds, which had lived and evolved long enough to develop saponin.  Why and how did we find them again?<br /><br />For an easy, exotic recipe using Quinoa, see my review of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024CW1O\">Virgin Coconut Oil (Certified Organic) 12 fl.oz</a><br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several KINDLE books and Amazon Shorts, including The Rose and the Pyramid\n",

      "If you've largely had only pan-fired (Chinese style) green teas, the kind of green tea they sell in American supermarkets, this tea will probably seem surprisingly flavorful.  It will likely strike you as bold, but still possessing of some nuance; it won't seem too sharp and there will be some slight awareness of a vegetable flavor.<br /><br />That was my experience at least, and the reason I think it depended on my drinking history was that I received a very large quantity of high-grade gyuokuro tea as a birthday present.  It took maybe two months for me to finish that stock, and returning to this tea, I found it bitter and unsubtle-tasting.<br /><br />I've readjusted and appreciate this tea again.  I prefer it because I drink liters of tea a day (I'm what the Japanese would deride as a \"tea gulper\" rather than a \"tea drinker\" or a \"tea sipper\") and it's more economical.  It can even taste good, depending on your history.  I'd recommend it to most Americans who want to give steamed (Japanese style) green tea a try, at least as their starting point.  It's somewhat reminiscent of the supermarket green teas actually, except perhaps bolder and slightly more nuanced, and if they think it's an improvement over those teas then they might want to try the more vegetable flavors of higher-grade senchas.\n",

      "I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I do enjoy a good cup of coffee (with creamer) every now and then.  While I did not like the aroma of the organic coffee pod straight out of the foil pack (the box says it is 'Exotic Floral and Berry' whatever that is), I did enjoy the taste of the brewed coffee, once I figured out how to brew it.  Like others, I was unaware these were for 'pod' brewers, although this has been since updated to state in the product description.<br /><br />In fact, the box has NO instructions whatsoever.  I had to come back to Amazon to find out about using 8oz of water per cup.  A little less Marley/Jamacia on the box, and a few more instructions would be helpful.<br /><br />Since I don't own a pod brewer, I tried using a pod in my 'cup at a time' brewer.  All I got was slightly flavored hot water.  Not recommended.  Next I tried brewing one directly in a cup by adding boiling water.  While I got flavor, I also got sediment and aftertaste.  Again, not the recommended method.  Finally, I tried snipping open a pod and just using the loose grounds in my 'cup at a time' brewer with a standard paper filter.  I realize this is not the way the manufacture intended their product to be used, but as I said, since I was unaware this product was for 'pod' coffee makers, it was the best I had to work with.<br /><br />At last, I got to taste Marley's Organic Coffee in a good way.  Overall, I did like the taste (I drink mine with creamer).  Although I have to admit that I would not buy these at such a high price for just 15 cups of coffee.  Maybe if I had a pod brewer, I would.  But I really don't taste that much different to any other cup of good coffee.  As I said, I am not a coffee connoisseur, just someone who enjoys a good cup on occasion.<br /><br />This box of Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee includes 15 individually foil wrapped coffee pods, so that each cup will be as fresh as the last.\n",

Poland Spring is a very nice water but to provide an analogy; if Poland Spring is the Cadillac of water then Volvic is the Mercedes.... although the French would probably disagree.<br /><br />Be warned; if you buy a couple of bottles, you will be hooked and start buying two cases per month like we do.

I would recommend at least trying this syrup and definately use it for a root beer float!\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "I've always wanted to try some of the Starbucks coffee. Since we don't have a Starbucks in the little town that I live in and what they have in the grocery store is so expensive I haven't had a chance to till now. So when it was on my Vine List to try out I jumped on it.<br />  Most of the other vanilla flavored coffee's that I've tried have had a very strong vanilla flavor to them. So I usually have to cut it 2 to 1 or Â½ & Â½ with some Folgers to get the level of Vanilla flavor that I like.  But this Starbucks Vanilla Coffee doesn't seem to have very much Vanilla flavor to it at all. I made the first pot of it like I usually do with the flavored coffee's and mixed it 2 to 1, 2 parts Starbucks to 1 part Folgers. I could hardly taste the Vanilla at all in that pot so the next one I made with just the Starbucks coffee. This time it had a slight and very light Vanilla flavor. It was still a very good pot of coffee but it didn't have much of a Vanilla flavor to it.<br />  So if your looking for a flavored coffee with a lot of Vanilla to it then you will be disappointed. But if your looking for one with a slight and very lite Vanilla flavor in it then you will love this one. If you have never tried a flavored coffee I would definitely suggest trying this. It has just enough Vanilla to it to say that it does and it's a great tasting coffee.\n",

The other ones have poorly constructed flavor profiles in my considered opinion. Sometimes if you want to go lowfat, you really need to go simple with the seasoning, and it doesn't get much simpler than salt and pepper.\n",

      "------------------\n",
      "My puppy has been on way too many dog foods: Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and now ZiwiPeak. Out of the four, I'd say this is the best but also the most expensive. A 2.2lb bag lasts probably 3 weeks at most, but at least I know I'm feeding her raw without the mess of raw. It's not cheap but considering how much it costs for us to eat out per meal, $28/bag for 3 weeks really isn't much on the larger scheme of things. It also helps that she loves this stuff and gobbles it up and we know she's not getting any filler. For those who are concerned that the serving size in the back is too little, we had the same concern. But after giving her more than what was recommended, we noticed our puppy was not finishing her bowl of food each time which told us that she was already full and didn't even want more. So if you're used to feeding your dog kibble, the reason there's less to feed her is because there's no filler and it's just meat, meat and more meat so they fill up on it without having to process things like potato. I've also noticed that my dog sneezes and farts significantly less. She used to get eye stains but after we switched to Orijen and now ZiwiPeak, we noticed that her stains disappeared all together!<br /><br />Unless my puppy has any health or allergy issues to ZiwiPeak, I will never switch her to any other brand or type of food!\n",

      "I love sweet tea, but I wanted an alternative to your normal black tea that is used to make this and that was caffeine free not just decaffeinated. I found out about Rooibos tea which is naturally caffeine free. Initially I just bought the regular rooibos tea and added peach flavoring from a local coffee shop. Then one day when I went to purchase another box of tea a sales associate recommended that I try Bigelow's Organic Rooibos with Asian Pear Tea. The first thing I noticed about this tea when I started making it was how good it smelled, and the taste...Let's just say I haven't gone back to the regular tea and peach flavoring since. Plus I save alot of money not having to add the separate flavor. I love this tea, and everyone should try it. Also on Amazon this tea was less than if I had bought it in the store. Thanks Amazon.\n",

That way,when the granola is gone,the milk has a bit of a chocolate taste and makes for a good tasting final \"slurp\".

NO...but they taste just fine (it's mostly a texture difference...these are smoother and not as granular/cake/flour like as a normal corn or flour tortilla) and will turn nearly any variety of unhealthy compliment (i.e. cheddar cheese, etc.) into something that's not too bad for you!  Looking at the ingredients, it looks like they're getting most of the fiber content from oat fiber, so that explains why these don't taste overly wheat-like.\n",

      "Well, lets say that I wish that I had heeded the warning of other reviewers. Since there were so many great and so many bad reviews, I didn't know what to make of it all - thought that possibly this was a fair cup of coffee, but that other reviewers had above average tastes in coffee. Nope. They're just regular old coffee drinkers like me that just don't want a funky taste, and funkier aftertaste. Not too much to ask from a finely brewed cup of coffee. I bought the French Roast...reviews of Fog Chaser were worse stating it tasted like dishwater, ashtray, etc.<br /><br />Let me start by saying, other reviewers are correct that once you open the sealed bag, you must contain them in something else because it will not stay fresh. I just put mine in an empty coffee container because I am just lazy with my coffee...that is afterall why I own a Keurig...ease of use and a quality cup of coffee. Once I opened the outer sealed bag, I couldn't help but think it smelled like something that may have washed ashore on the San Francisco Bay!! I did approach it with an open mind, however, and brewed a cup of coffee.<br /><br />It is easy to use just like traditional k-cups, despite the uniquely different design. I did get coffee grounds in my cup (really just a few), and that has happened to me before so I did not want to fault the product for that. As for the taste...that's where I fault the product itself!!! I gave this two stars because it is drinkable. Barely. I will fight my way though this pack, and never order again!! Let me put into this context for you...the coffee that I have drank at work from the old, stained coffee maker with some cheap store brand grounds thrown in tastes way better than this.<br /><br />There are other ways to save a buck with your machine...there's that giant gray bullet looking filter contraption, there's a small red plastic version, there's the snap on lids, and then there's the aluminum foil that someone recently introduced me to. So here goes...I'll give you a break down of all that I've listed.<br />Giant Gray Bullet Filter - Does NOT taste anything like a traditional k-cup brewed cup of coffee, but by FAR better than this coffee here! The downside with this is that you have to push out the inner part of the machine that the k-cup usually rests in. Dishwasher safe though.<br /><br />Small Red plastic and metal mesh filter - tastes closer to a traditional k-cup, and no popping out the machines inner parts. Have to dump grinds into garbage, but it is dishwasher safe. Good option. Also sold on Amazon.<br /><br />Snap on lids - Amazon sells snap on metal or plastic lids. I have the metal ones. With these, you have to peel the foil off of your k-cup after first use and dump out grounds, and clean them out. Sounds like a hassle, but I guess that I've gotten used to it. Put two scoops of any coffee grounds that you like, snap the lid on, put it in your machine and brew as usual. Out comes a good quality cup of coffee that tastes the same as the traditional k-cup. Possibly because the filter and the cup are what you are reusing. Now someone recently told me that you can reuse the same k-cup over and over again, until the filter gives out. Haven't tried yet.<br /><br />Aluminum Foil - first of all why didn't I think of that!! A k-cup only has a small piece of foil on top that the machine pierces. Really. So obvious that I can't believe that I never thought of it. Tried it the other day. Here's the scoop...still have to empty out a k-cup as you would with the above methods, add coffee grinds, etc. Tore off a small piece of foil, tried to get it just right around the lip because you can't just slap foil over it and have it fit in the machine with all of the excess foil...so it started to feel like a bit of a craft project. Once I got it to fit, I brewed a cup of coffee that tasted like what I have come to expect from a Keurig machine. There were a few grounds that fell into the coffee, but no more than with this crappy coffee!! I will perfect this aluminum foil method...measure, and pre-cut circles one day when I have time.<br /><br />Truly, I have no spare time, which is why I RARELY review a product, but I felt strongly enough about this terrible product, that I should save someone else the palatal distress! Not worth the money! Not worth feeling like you wasted your money when you throw them away! Not worth having to endure 36 cups of sub-standard coffee!! Again I'm no no connoisseur...just a regular coffee drinker!\n",

My little long haired boy sees the box and spins until I give him one. They are soft and are manageable for the tiny dogs with tiny teeth. Sojos came out with a statement that they DO NOT USE any of the peanut butter affected by the recent recalls. So you can relax if you want to try them!\n",

Loading their plastic holder from the plastic packages they supply is just a pain ... funny thing, the plastic pouches arent recyclable. The whole thing is, frankly, a mess ... I suppose it reduces waste to some degree, but it should be to a great degree for the cost. At minimum go to paper or recyclable pouches. The price point seems to be designed to provide about a 10 cent advantage, which just isnt enough ... especially since you need to drink 120 cups to work off the cost of the reusable container before saving anything ... it might be *IF* it was trully Eco friendly. I'll not be buying any more of these, I can buy a canister of coffee and get the same effect with any of the reloadable cups available and not only be ecologically sensitive but actually save a bundle to boot.

Athens baklava was moist (not crispy) with plenty of dripping syrup and a hint of honey; there were 3 layers of nuts which were firm but not crunchy and there were subtle overtones of cinnamon and allspice (I think) and a hint of citrus zest. Fabulous!<br />This Shatila Mediterranean-Mideast baklava is disappointing: the single nut layer is moist, but the philo layers are crispy and mostly dry but have a strong butter-like flavor, and a greasy consistency (a-la butter flavored crisco?) There is a single layer of nuts which lacks spice or complex flavors...mostly just nutty; it is mildly sweet, less so than most baklava; no real syrup to speak of...just tastes sweet without even a hint of honey.  It tastes ok, but not what I was hoping for.  Seems fresh, and delivery was quick. Just my 2 cents.\n",

      "I've urged Amazon to change this product's listing so as not to trick anyone else into buying it, but until they do, I want to add my voice to the revelations hidden in a few reviews that are already here. Please be warned that while the first cup of this coffee is tasty, the second is unlikely to be as good, and the twelfth is almost guaranteed to be disappointing unless you're the twelve-cup-a-day sort of household.<br /><br />Why? Simply put, these are not K-Cups. They are not individually sealed portions, but instead are open mesh coffee pods, not dissimilar to Senseo pods, topped with a K-Cup-like plastic ring and foil cover. That cover does make them work in Keurig brewers, but you lose the important freshness-preserving feature of K-Cups. The company could lessen this problem by putting its pods in a resealable plastic bag, but they chose to instead use a plastic bag reminiscent of those in cereal boxes -- just much, much harder to open. That's especially ironic given Amazon's recent move toward frustration-free packaging.<br /><br />I strongly encourage you to move on to another product until the San Francisco Bay Coffee folks can temper their (laudable) green-focused pod design with some reasonable solution for keeping the coffee fresh for more than a day or so once you open the box.\n",

      "This product is essentially ground up pepper ingredients.  It even looks like pepper, and smells somewhat like pepper.  The three main, active ingredients are:<br /><br />#1.  Oil of black pepper:  0.48% by weight.<br />#2.  Piperine (comes from black pepper): 0.185% by weight.<br />#3.  Capsaicin: 0.032% by weight.<br /><br />The other 99.3% are \"other ingredients\".<br /><br />When you open the big blue jug, please note, it is five pounds by weight, but the jug is about 3/4 full, so visually you get the impression its a bigger quantity by volume than five pounds actually is.<br /><br />I used it around the perimeter of my home, which is regularly visited by a couple of stray cats, chipmunks, and deer.  I also have a pet dog and cat.  I did not expect miracles, and as with any product of this type, you need to accept that it is a deterrent, which hopefully minimizes these unwelcome visitors, nothing tends to eliminate intrusion by these animals completely.<br /><br />While pepper odor can be an effective deterrent to ward off some animals, I find it effective sometimes and ineffective other times.  Some animals will deal with it and others will move on.<br /><br />I did not find that this product made any difference at all in the amount of pests who frequent my property.  I tried a couple of applications in various places.  None of the chipmunks, cats, squirrels that I observed seemed to notice its presence at all.  I did not spread it thin and I followed the instructions.  In fact, I ended up applying it heavier than instructed, and still no noticeable difference in animal visits.<br /><br />But, if you do want to include pepper in your deterrent approach, I do not see any reason to pay $5 or $6 a pound for this product.  5 pounds amounts to 80 ounces.  Since the active ingredients (various forms of pepper) make up less than 3/4 of one percent of this jar, or about half an ounce, you could buy black pepper and some hot pepper powder or sauce and make your own, homemade powder for far less.<br /><br />For deterring deer from flowers and shrubs, I use a mixture of tap water, some chili powder and one egg (left to rot in a one gallon plastic bottle), along with some liquid dish soap for adhesion.  So you could possibly not use the egg (attracts some animals, even when rotten) and add a little more pepper, dish soap or baking soda.  You'd end up with something that would work as well as this product.\n",

      "To start with, I'll be upfront about a few things:<br /><br />A) I got this coffee free to try through the Amazon Vine program.<br /><br />B) I don't have a pod coffee maker, so I ripped open several bags and put the grounds in a normal filter, making a full 10 cup pot at a time.<br /><br />This said, I'm not in much of a position to assess the pod concept as I didn't use them this way.<br /><br />As far as the coffee itself.  Its fair, but not great.  Like other reviewers have mentioned its pretty weak stuff.  The taste kinda reminds me of a smoother McDonalds coffee.  Not bold by any means, but certainly drinkable if you're open to that kind of thing.<br /><br />I prefer a stronger flavor, so I won't be buying it again.\n",

      "I started drinking this tea after the same company took half the tea out of what had been my favorite teabags (their white silver needle).  These fun blooming tea balls are strong enough for more than a cup of tea.  But a tip: the little flowers that blossom on the string come off and float around in the tea the second time around.  So you either have to strain the second cup, or do what I usually do: make a small pot and get 2-3 cups of tea from each blossom.  I make the tea for myself and guests in glass mugs to take full advantage of the pretty blooms.  Although it's a bit of a waste of the decorative bloom, when I don't have plain jasmine green on hand, I also like to make iced tea from these.  The flavor has enough zip for a really refreshing change of taste.\n",

I didn't detect any off flavors or nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />I tried it on a roll-up with roast beef and cheese, and it was a nice compliment.<br /><br />I think it would be a bit too spicy for me to use as a salad dressing (a serving suggestion), but I can see using this on a hamburger, roast beef sandwich, fajitas, baked potato, or a panini. I can also see using this as a dip for veggies or fried appetizers like mushrooms, poppers, or even calamari.<br /><br />It ain't health food and I don't expect many healthy ingredients, but on the whole this isn't too bad.

      "I was initially shocked when I initially opened my parcel and found these very cool new San Francisco Bay Coffee Organic One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Rainforest Blend, 80-Count. First this is a great value at $33.00 including free shipping with my Prime Account. For those of you who have not tried Prime membership it pays for itself in between 60-90 days with moderate use and I believe Amazon still offers a 30 day free trial which is worth looking at to experience the benefits. I've had my membership for 3 years and its a great value! Enough for the the Amazon commercial back to the coffee. Price per cup is the lowest I have found anywhere at just under 42 cents. The normal K-cups are all plastic while these have a plastic ring with a fiber filter bag. Its not 100% recyclable but its a big step forward as the filter will break down quickly and the coffee grounds will then fall out allowing those to decompose as well. That leaves a small plastic ring (which looks recyclable) and foil top left. To assist to keep your coffee fresh you receive a reusable lightweight recyclable plastic tub with an airtight lid that holds about 8 K-cups for peak freshness. In addition each 8 K-Cups is sealed in a vented recyclable bag inside the box so you open one and put them in the storage tub after. Nice touch.<br /><br />This is a robust organic coffee with a smooth finish, its gives me above average caffeine buzz, please note I am not big coffee drinker, more a 1-2 good cups a day guy and I like to have variety, thus my move to a Keurig system (which I love and have spread this to 6 others in my family as well as many at my office). Thi is a good coffee with nice flavor and I also like the fact its organic, a little more recyclable and a good value. A++++\n",

(I do not make pumpkin pie - don't like it.)<br /><br />I was really happy to find this brand on Amazon in 2011 for half of the price I pay through my food club when the product is on special sale.....and about 1/3 of the price that is charged when it's not on sale.<br /><br />It's really good pumpkin.  My original review gave this pumpkin only 4 stars because at that time it didn't come in a BPA free can.  It is now October, 2012 and I recently received a second case from Amazon and was delighted to read \"BPA FREE\" on the label.<br /><br />Thanks, Farmers Market, for caring about our health!  You earned your 5th star.<br /><br />The pumpkin is still a very good price now in 2012 IF you order it in the \"frustration free packaging\" from Amazon, but only slightly less than my food club.  But, hey, pennies count!\n",

      "I received a variety of Stash teas as a Bridal Shower souveneir over a year ago. I'm sorry i took so long to bust 'em open. Stash is an amazing quality with natural tasting, comforting flavours in both the Herbal and Black Tea lines. I am so impressed, I've become a Stash convert.<br /><br />This Double Chai is very well balanced in it's spices, but still comforting and yet refreshing at the same time. I made mine mostly according to the directions (tea is easy that way), but i did use sweetened condensed milk instead of regular milk and sugar. It may not be 'Starbucks Quality' as one reviewer lamented, but I'm sure the beauty of Chai is that it can be well made in a variety if different ways. And while i've never been big into Chai, in the future, I'm definitely going to keep a stock of this Chai tea in my pantry. And unlike many other common brands of black tea, this one does not go bitter after 5-10 minutes of steeping. I'm used to having to be vigilant about removing the bag after 3 minutes, because I'm sensitive to the bitter over-steeped taste of lower quality black teas. That was not at all an issue with either of the black teas I've tried from this company. I can't wait to buy more Stash Teas.\n",

      "****<br />Tazo's Passion Herbal Infusion is a somewhat tart, deep, flavorful (hibiscus-y tasting) tea. It is not berry-like in taste, although it is red in color. It's difficult to describe what hibiscus tastes like, but I find it a most pleasant taste. My husband says it tastes like pomegranate to him. Although Passion contains licorice root it is not sweet.<br /><br />The ingredients in Passion are: hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy. It is caffeine-free!<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, \"The Reincarnation of Tea\". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some \"natural flavors\" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, \"A tantalizing deep red tea made from hibiscus flowers, exotic herbs and natural tropical flavors.\" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as \"berry, juicy, wine-like, merlot, sweet, earthy, dense\". Tazo describes the aroma as \"sweet, juicy, red fruits\".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as other teas such as Numi, which is why Tazo Passion gets only four stars.<br />****\n",

These bars are quite tasty and I think my son summed it up best by describing them as gingersnaps crossed with an oatmeal walnut raisin cake.

My husband didn't care for them because of the walnuts and seeds. He says he didn't like all that extra \"work\" to eat his snack bar. He isn't one for nuts in his snack foods, either, so... He gave it between 2-3 stars.<br /><br />My son ate all his and said it was OK, but he wouldn't go out and buy a box to have around to snack on. He gave it 3 stars.<br /><br />Me - well I thought they were really very good. I enjoyed that extra texture supplied by the chia seeds, and I love oatmeal, raisins, nuts and coconut in my snacks. I'm all about flavors and textures, and this one was a hit for me! I'm giving it 5 stars.<br /><br />Each box contains five 40g (1.41oz) bars.

I desperately wanted this mix to work as I am currently enduring a maternal avoidance diet courtesey of my 8 month old's multiple, severe food allergies.  I cannot tell you how I looked forward to the day I tried this \"safe\" mix.  Unfortunately, I consider the money spent on this mix to be a total waste.<br /><br />The two main problems with it are, in the following order:<br /><br />1)  Gritty texture.  The grit is not horrible but it IS there and you cannot help but notice it.  For the amount of money charged per box of mix, they surely must be able to improve the texture of this product!<br /><br />2)  Overwhelming vanilla.  The recipe calls for an excessive amount of vanilla, which leaves an almost sickening aftertaste to the cookies.  I triple checked the back of the box before pouring out the specified amount because it looked so off to me.  While the amount of vanilla IS something that can be tweaked at home, I feel it is inappropriate and unacceptable for the buyer of this product to have to make ANY changes to the recipe/ingredient ratios to produce a consistently pleasing, tasty cookie.<br /><br />The whole concept of this mix, it seems to me, is to provide people with severely restricted diets a quick, easy, AND delicious treat that would otherwise have been made from scratch.  After my experience, I would rather cook from scratch every day for the rest of my life than make these again.<br /><br />Hopefully someone at Cherrybrook looks at improving/refining this recipe...soon!\n",

The heated tea is nicely turned immediately, boldly, vividly, orange in color.  I don't need to add much sweetener even as it's tart but its tartness gives it more taste.<br /><br />The only drawbacks are its high price (compared to other teas which is why I'm always waiting for a sale on them) and having to wait to heat the water and waiting to cool it down in the refrigerator (or quickly in the freezer).  It's true as another reviewer said that it's very strong in taste after just leaving it in hot water for a few seconds so the longer you leave it in, the stronger and bitter or more tart it becomes and you could really be frugal and only need a tea bag for a half gallon to a gallon of water.  Adding ice helps dilute the taste as well as cool the tea down fast and cold, but I like my iced tea strong so i can taste its full flavor, so I try never to add ice.<br /><br />It's a delight as an everyday iced tea as well as a great gift for a friend.\n",

I have never purchased grain free dog food, so I don't have any real comparison and it may all be this way. I do however always buy low-fat food. I tried the grain free because my dogs get dry, itchy skin and thought it might help.

In an effort to find a bath wash that wasn't too obnoxious or coarse in it's ingredients, I've been through a couple brands. Knowing this, this one came as a gift from my girlfriend at the time. So far, this is one of my favorites. I don't really have sensitive skin per se but the mildness of both it's fragrance and it's texture, or lack thereof, work good for my skin. The only minus, though I personally don't mind, is that it is advertised as \"unscented\" yet a scent is clearly apparent.<br /><br />It has no impact on the actual relevance of the product as a cleansing agent but I really like the look of the graphic design and industrial design of the product itself. The color scheme is nice and the bottle is easy to handle without slipping out of my hands. When the bath soap is getting low it also seems to do well at getting the last bits out unlike a lot of other brands I've tried where you have to pound the thing to get the last quarter of liquid out. The upside down orientation of the nozzle helps with this tremendously as does the shape of the bottle, I assume. Pretty good!\n",

It was the natural home moisturizer and beauty treatment there.  Ask any Indian woman how she has such long, strong beautiful hair and she'll tell you its because she conditions her hair and massages her scalp with coconut oil.  I'm not Indian but I'm a girl who has been trying to maintain long hair and suffering from split ends, but reluctant to trim too much and I admired the healthy state of their hair.<br /><br />Its a great moisturizer and also its healthy for you if you want to cook with, its very good for digestion and provides healthy saturated fats.  I know it sounds counter intuitive, but certainly do your own research and don't go against doctors orders.<br /><br />Don't go overboard with consumption or cooking with it, but I was informed having a tablespoon with each meal is beneficial, just be careful not to consume after your meal if you want weight loss.<br /><br />I personally use coconut as a hair conditioner, moisturizer, in place of butter and cooking oil.<br />I use Parachute for only beauty/moisturizing reasons because I find that the opening does not make it easy to extract the oil for cooking because half the year the temperature makes the oils solid and the opening is for the oil in a more liquid state.<br /><br />The coconut oil solidifies when the surrounding temperature is cooler.  This particular bottle makes it difficult to squeeze out if the temperature is too low.  I'd recommend placing the closed bottle it in a bowl of warm to hot water to help melt it a bit.<br /><br />This product is very inexpensive.  Avoid other products that are not 100% pure coconut oil.\n",

It is \"just enough\" when you want to reward them without having to worry about making a mess in the car.  I am not sure if this concept will catch on with the mainstream, but as long as it is competitively priced, I can see this being a useful tool for many dog-rearing activities.

Funny enough it really is a nice flavor.<br /><br />Izze also offers this beverage in a just over 8 oz. a can.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.<br /><br />This is not a hydration beverage as much as a tasty treat.  It is not unhealthy so you don't need to feel guilty by downing one or two of these in a day.  Not calorie free but not too bad either.  The taste is not overly sweet.  I have heard from others who consider it bitter.  I disagree.  I think this bitter taste is from tastebuds too used to sugary sodas.<br /><br />A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book\n",

      "We began feeding natural foods after 2 of our cats developed \"asthma\". The veterinarians treated them with prednisone and the cats became sicker and sicker.  We switched to natural foods and the asthma completely disappeared, never to return.  So, we fed natural foods for years, then picked up a few strays that refused to eat them and we went a while feeding low quality grocery store brands to those cats just so we didn't end up throwing away a lot of natural food.  Then we tried this and every one of our 6 cats are totally thrilled with it and lick their bowls clean.  We are not throwing any food away and feel great about feeding a high-quality food once again to our cats.  We have also had great luck with Evangers pheasant and Wellness Core.  The natural pet food companies seem to be working hard to make their foods tastier.  If you have tried natural foods before and have been disappointed with their palatability, you should definitely give this a try.\n",

We eventually figured out it was the dry cat food.  We started feeding them Holistic Select which is corn and wheat free. Now we seldom find throw-up and if we do, it's because of hair balls.  What a difference!  We have been sold on Holistic Select Adult and Kitten Health food for the past year and we will continue to use it even though it is a bit costly compared to the other dry foods we were using.

In fact, as I waited, I became quite impatient and actually strangled a homeless man. It wasn't my finest hour, nor is it something I'm proud of. Regardless, I rather quickly descended into a life a crime and drug abuse. But soon, the UPS man delivered my order; I was ecstatic! I quickly made the macaroni & cheese, keeping strictly to the directions on the box. I did have a little trouble trying to get the packet of cheese out of the little, perforated hole out of which the macaroni is poured, but it only proved to be a temporary setback to my redemption. Upon completion of the meal, I fell into a pool of joy as the warm, cheesy elbow macaroni noodles slid down my throat and into my stomach. Suddenly, I found myself free from my drug addiction! I couldn't believe it; all my withdrawal symptoms disappeared quicker than Judy Winslow from \"Family Matters.\" I then said to myself, \"If this can do that for me, I wonder what other wrongs I can correct. I found the homeless man I had earlier killed and force fed the mac & cheese to him. Much to my surprise, he soon revived and thanked me for the meal, as that's all he had ever wanted. He later became a successful businessman, and has only the mac & cheese to thank for it. After fixing all the problems I had caused, I ate the last spoonful of mac & cheese. Not long after mastication, Publisher's Clearing House showed up to my front door with a check for $5 million! I attribute all my success in life from that day onward to the box of KRAFT MACARONI & CHEESE.<br /><br />At $60 a box, it is a bit pricey, but well worth it.\n",

I bought this on a whim after I had got fed up with wasting money on toys marketed as \"super durable\" and for \"power chewers\" that she would demolish in minutes and would ultimately end up garbage in a day. I figured the treat would keep her busy for while and the rubber felt fairly strong. Boy was I impressed! First though I have to mention that my dog has some unpleasant behavior with certain treat items (rawhides, beef bones, pigs ears) in that she has a drive to bury these things in what ever she can cover it with, which often tends to be bedding or under rugs. SO once I put the treat in the ball she was bound and determined to \"bury\" it in our apartment. The treat got nixed and I gave her just the ball. It has been her favorite toy for years! In fact she once lost it playing in her grandmas muddy yard on a rainy day, looked all over for it and gave up. She was devastated, kept searching for it at home, I was really surprised because she's never gotten attached to a toy like that before. I went out and hunted down a new one for her. Well about a year later while at her grandmas house I let her in from the yard and she's got TWO of these in her mouth the old one and the new one! Leave it to her to find it after all this time. I purchased the first one when she was 2yrs, it spent almost a year outside in Wisconsin's elements and yet it is still in perfect on condition going on 3 years old! Will post photo.

I wanted a black that I could use without having to start with chocolate icing (birthday girl does not like chocolate!). It turned snow-white marshmallow fondant BLACK, with very little of the gel and no noticeable taste difference. I was afraid that the coloring would leave my hands purple or blue, but the only place I noticed a stain was where I touched the full-strength coloring directly--once I mixed it in with the melted marshmallow before mixing the powdered sugar in to make the fondant, there were not problems with stains. I can't say if it would stain stone counters, though--I was not brave enough to test it on my granite, and so I kneaded the fondant on wax paper. Like other reviewers, I was a Wilton fan for years, but love this new alternative and will definitely be using AmeriColor from now on.\n",

They probably would have been fine for cooking, but they did not perform up to my expectations. I have been making Vanilla extract for the last 5+ years or so and that's why I bought the beans.  I make 750mL at a time using vodka as the base. I cut up 4 beans and began soaking them a week before Christmas.  After 2 weeks the extract was not strengthening correctly (too light of a color) so I added 2 more beans.  Now that it is the end of January (over a month of soaking) they still have not extracted properly. I have the last batch to compare it to (different beans -- I believe Tahitian) and the current batch is half the shade and strength of the previous with 50% more beans.

Scent falls flat<br /><br />-Taste<br /><br />+Unsweetened:<br />++Hot (.5) - Does not taste like anything other than normal tea.<br />++Iced (1) - again no flavor is present aside from just tea to me<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average.<br /><br />-Sweetened<br />++Hot (1.5)- Adding the sweetener (.5 pkg of truvia) usually makes flavors stick out, and until I added the sweetener I didn't detect anything other than just black tea.<br />++Iced (2) -  So Iced with sweetener is the only way I find this tea to be enjoyable.<br /><br />2nd Steep (2) it maintains its flavor through a second steep but I'm still not impressed.<br /><br />Summary -  I really wanted to like this tea but it just didn't do it for me. The tea was very weak, perhaps I will try to double the strength in a few days and update my rating. to me it just tastes very bland.<br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp per 16 oz water) \"steep\" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference. I use plain Lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.<br /><br />I have many other tea reviews so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea).<br /><br />*** I have spoken with the seller who has assured me the tea is not old. You cant make everyone happy flavor wise and this was just not for my palette, I have a feeling it may be due to tea having no sweetener added and I prefer a sweetness to my tea. I am very pleased with the professionalism of the seller  and I will be giving them the full rating.\n",

Bisquick is a baking mix that has flour, shortening and leavening already mixed up and ready-to-go for making biscuits or pancakes. In fact, if you read the history of Betty Crocker, and General Mills, you will discover Bisquick was developed after a company employee enjoyed hot biscuits while traveling on the train. The employee wondered how the train's cook was able to bake up the biscuits so quickly. The cook showed the General Mills employee his pre-made biscuit mix. Bisquick was created after the General Mills employee returned from his trip.<br /><br />Today, you can use Bisquick to make pancakes, waffles, muffins, quick breads, cookies and Impossibly Easy Pies. It is a true workhorse in the kitchen.<br /><br />Books you can read about General Mills and Bisquick include <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0816650187\">Finding Betty Crocker: The Secret Life of America's First Lady of Food (Fesler-Lampert Minnesota Heritage)</a>; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1605298166\">Betty Crocker Ultimate Bisquick Cookbook Exclusive Deluxe Edition 323 Delicious recipes for breakfast, dinner, dessert & more!</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470916575\">Bisquick to the Rescue: More than 100 Emergency Meals to save the day!</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764559176\">Betty Crocker Bisquick Impossibly Easy Pies: Pies that Magically Bake Their Own Crust</a>.<br /><br />Highly recommend.\n",

      "Ok, let's be honest.  There was no doubt in my mind that Harry, Pepper, and Honey would love these treats.  Dixie, on the other hand... well, I wasn't sure.<br /><br />Dixie is right there with everyone else when the treat bag is opened, but when she gets her treat, more often than not she goes back to her spot, lies down with the treat in front of her, and she guards it for a while.  Later we'll find it under the furniture or half buried in the yard.  The really yummy treats (hot dogs, anyone?) are gulped on the spot, but everything else is hoarded for, I guess, the day we forget to feed her.<br /><br />But not these.  Dixie was right there in the lineup, waiting for her treat.  Everyone got one, and there was much loud crunching to be heard.  A couple of minutes later, everyone was back, doing the cookie dance, trying to convince me that I'd somehow forgotten them, and Dixie was right there with them.  The second cookie was crunched as quickly (and as loudly) as the first.<br /><br />This was shortly after dinner, so I know it wasn't starvation that drove her to it.<br /><br />Honey is the smallest, at about 50 pounds, so these are big dogs, and a whole, unbroken treat was the right size for them.  I'd guess that breaking the treat at the halfway mark would make them the right size for a medium sized dog.  Toy breed owners might want to get out the hammer.<br /><br />These are very hard treats, so they're probably good for the teeth.  They left quite a few crumbs when crunched, but the crumbs were gone in seconds.  The package was hard, too... you should be able to tear it at the notch, but mine was still sealed when I tore off the top.  You might want to have scissors handy.<br /><br />Currently the package promises \"Made with organic barley - no wheat - no corn\".  The ingredients are \"Organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), organic molasses.\"  Hey, these dogs eat better than I do!<br /><br />Guaranteed analysis:<br /><br />Crude protein: 9.0% min.<br />Crude fat: 4.0% min.<br />Crude fiber: 4.0% max.<br />Moisture: 11% max.<br /><br />Of course all that information may change, but since it's not in the description right now I thought I'd include it.<br /><br />Seems like good ingredients, might be good for dogs with food allergies, and they sure are popular here.  They're a little out of my price range, but that's understandable given the organic ingredients and lack of wheat, corn, and meat by-products.  Eight paws up here!\n",

Tried vacuuming, cleaning, swatting, and spraying, but the little guys just kept multiplying.  I saw these moth traps at Home Depot after I had ordered another brand on Amazon.  I picked up two traps at Home Depot.  The next day, I also received the other brand from Amazon.  The Safer brand caught 4 moths in an entire day.  Since that time, all 4 moths have gotten loose and went on the prowel.  The sticky pad does not work.  The other brand I bought is full of moths.  The moths just swarmed to it immediately.  The moths flew around the Safer moth trap, but very few of them actually entered the trap.  It is designed just like the other brands, so it puzzles me why the moths will not enter the trap.  I set the Safer and Biocare moth traps in the same room.  The biocare worked so well that I have to order more to replace the two that are completely full of moths.  In the meantime, I will leave the Safer moth traps in place just to see if they will catch any moths with the other traps removed.  So far, after a few hours, the traps have not caught one moth.<br /><br />I seen the good an the bad reviews on this brand.  Thought I would try it.  Evidently, it is a quality control issue since some people have good results, and others; like me, have had no results whatsoever.\n",

One kcup will be actually almost pleasant (though the raspberry overtones *always* have a \"tinny\" aftertaste), and the next will be so strong in both scent and flavor that it is unbearable and gets dumped.<br /><br />If the flavor/strength of the chocolate and raspberry were consistent throughout, it would be two and a half stars.

This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium.

The flavor is nice, the apples rather generous, and it's light on the sweetness (which allows you to ratchet up the sweetness to your taste, which I appreciate).<br /><br />The texture IS NOT creamy right off, and this is a thing with instant oatmeals in general. Once you add the boiling water, let it sit for 3-5 minutes. I find when I let it sit about, stirring it up now and then, it gets to a truly comforting and nice \"gloopy\" oatmeal texture. If you just add water and stir--it will be \"pebbly\" and dry. Not nice. So, remember to give it time to get to the right texture.<br /><br />The ingredients list is minimal (which I like), the taste is very nice and \"clean\", and I tend to sweeten it just  a bit more. I also tend to use two packets, but then, I used to use two packets of Quaker, etc, as well.<br /><br />Another good product from Dr. M. Hurrah!\n",

      "So I am drinking this water with my family right now and I am seriously concerned that we are all about to die.  The amount of fulvic acid that some people are considering good for them makes my anus feel like it is about to explode about 30 minutes after drinking a bottle. That being said, I am considering ordering a case for my next cult suicide.  (Yes, Next) Now, on the subject of \"Enjoy the Dark Side\" I find that even comparing the god awful taste of this water to something as mild as the sith (compared to the water of course) is just insulting. Also, on the subject of my grammar that last sentance, it's possibly a side effect of the water's terribly written website, and the chemicals from all of the decaying plant matter that makes up 90% of the bottle. Now, on to that suicide.\n",

      "Many of us have experienced vodka from our youth, where it was popular for mixed drinks.  Having good taste was about paying a little more to minimize the impact in the morning.  We wouldn't notice the taste differences when used for mixed drinks, or drunk as frozen shots, often drunk quickly.<br /><br />We went to a vodka tasting recently that featured 5 vodkas of varying prices and made from different ingredients.  We sampled them straight up / neat, one at a time.  The best of the lot was the Karlsson Gold.  Yes, it was a tasting sponsored by Karlsson, but it had a good selection of other vodkas, including one we had been buying, but I was impressed enough that we bought a bottle to enjoy at home from the local store (thirty-two dollars).<br /><br />The flavor from the Swedish potatoes is quite good.  There is more flavor than just the vaguely sweet flavor I find in vodka.  It is difficult to describe, but I imagine that someone who appreciates dry brandies might enjoy it.<br /><br />Because this is about flavor, you would not use Karlsson Gold in mixed drinks.  You probably would not taste the difference, and it costs more than less flavorful but otherwise good brands.<br /><br />These are first impressions.  I'll update the review in a few months, or when the bottle goes dry, whichever comes first, and give my thinking then.\n",

      "I was lucky enough to discover Biscoff Spread  (with smudged labels) at the 99 cents store and decided to give it a try since I am such a fan of the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001FFK40\">Biscoff brand of Belgian speculoos cookies</a> that they have served for many years on Delta Air Lines.  It's an odd concept, a spread made of cookies, but I'm glad that I didn't let that stop me from trying it.<br /><br />The label says that this is a \"European alternative to peanut butter.\"  I completely disagree as it it only has the look and texture of peanut butter.  It smells and tastes just like the Biscoff cookies, but sweeter, with a hint of caramelized sugar and cinnamon.  It is much more like dulce de leche than peanut butter.<br /><br />This spread is good with ice cream; on pancakes, scones, and apples; or just eaten from a spoon as a nice treat after a meal.  A thin layer even salvaged the plain graham crackers I bought by mistake instead of the cinnamon honey variety.  It would also be good on cupcakes, waffles, or popovers.  Eating it on toast doesn't appeal to me but maybe with raisin bread it would be good.  It really is tasty and hard to resist, especially with milk or coffee.<br /><br />The basic recipe for Biscoff spread is speculoos cookies, canola oil, and sugar so it's not particularly healthy.  Each tablespoon has 88 calories with 52 of them from fat.  On the bright side, a tablespoon only has 33 mg of sodium.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Biscoff 57% (wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oils [one or more of soy bean oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, palm oil], soy flour, brown sugar, sodium bicarbonate, salt, cinnamon), canola oil, sugar, soy lecithin, citric acid.\n",

For those with a sensitive nose can certainly make that distinction. Otherwise you'd say it smells the same. I am eager to get the CONDENSED MILK to get that restaurant taste down pat!\n",

I used to leave his toys laying around in his dog bed or crate, but found that he loses interest so I tend to rotate offering 2 or 3 toys every few days. Any small treat works well, as long as it's not his usual dog food. I thought it was a little expensive, but it's durable, easy to instill the treats, and challenging enough to keep him busy for at least a half an hour, but not so hard that he loses interest.

Gassines and spit up were greatly reduced after use of this milk.<br />The baby is mostly breastfed and only supplemented with alimentum during the night, just one feeding.<br />She just turned 5 months old and we are still using the same milk.<br />For the price tag you would have thought it came with a better smell  but no.<br />I am wondering what is the real reason under the high price. i doubt its the ingredients,cause once you start reading the label you kind of starting feeling guilty of what you are feeding your baby. Unfortunately mother nature did not fill up my boobies with enough milk for baby's demand so i have to supplement with what i think its best for my baby.<br />I personally think that most babies are going to be fussy,gassy and lots of other things during the first 6 weeks of their lives and most parents will try anything to comfort them, including buying this highly priced formula.<br />I wish that the ready to feed formula came in other sizes too, and lasted longer when opened than just one hour.<br />i would rate this with five stars only if it was a little cheaper.\n",

Although one needs a coffeemaker to make the tea - any coffeemaker from an expansive espresso to a simple drip machine will do.<br /><br />When I was making this rooibos tea, I had to go to work to make it and coworkers drifted in from their workspace to find out from where the luscious, rich smell of tea was emanating. a few were turned off by the idea of drinking tea from a coffeepot, but most were willing to entertain the idea.<br /><br />For them, just like for myself, the taste seemed interesting. By itself Red Espresso drink is too strong and too demanding. When mixed with apple juice though, the tea absolves all the acidic properties of the juice and the juice highlights the flavor of the tea. The tea becomes subtle and refreshing and spontaneous at the same time.<br /><br />I have yet to try other variations of this drink (the website has quite a few suggestions), but I found that drinking it as an iced tea is sufficient to keep me pleased ad to make me want to buy more of it (and to grab a coffeemaker while I'm at it).\n",

I'm so busy with these twins that I don't go far.  This purchase is convenient.  However, with applesauce-based food for the babies, I can buy large and more economical jars at the grocery store (the unsweetened varieties).<br /><br />I'm confident almost any baby will love this Earth's Best flavor combination right away.

This original recipe is better than what you buy in the store today - it has pure cane sugar as opposed to corn syrup, and you can taste the difference. Nice and crisp; a sharp sweetness that just can't be captured with corn syrup. I miss being able to drive a few miles to get this! We stocked up before we moved, but we've run out and are craving it :)<br /><br />I like how the big beverage companies are going \"retro\" and re-introducing their original tasty recipes with real sugar, and this is no exception.

Don't worry, the stems aren't a bother, I just eat them whole with some almonds or in a ground coconut and almond meal porridge in the morning.

What's more is it's only 110 calories & 10+ grams of protein per 8 ounces!  That's awesome in my book!\n",

My favorite 24 oz Arizona Iced Tea(black/white tea with sugar) has almost just as many calories(150) and almost 3 times the size of Switch.  Also, do not be tempted with \"100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin E\" pitch either.  Most of us consume 100% of daily Vitamin C without even trying through foods and anything extra get eliminated.<br /><br />The taste however does feel a bit more natural than other artificial orange sodas though, so that's the only plus.  Also, if you do not worry about gaining weight, I guess this is a good way to get a sugar rush in a tiny can.<br /><br />Overall, a good-tasting product, but there are many other low-caloric alternatives out there.  A can of Diet Coke and a multivitamin anyone?\n",

      "Prior to trying this product, I had been using the single-serving powder packs from various manufacturers -- Crystal Light, generic Wal-Mart brand, etc. -- so I would say those are the primary competition for a product like MiO. One thing MiO has going for it right away is that there is less mess involved. Sometimes the powdered drinks don't cooperate as well when being poured (I've accidentally inhaled some of that stuff) and they definitely don't mix in with water as seamlessly as a few drops of MiO does. The second advantage with MiO is it is easier to make your beverage stronger or weaker to taste than with the powdered packets. Sometimes I'd have a bigger beverage cup and would have to open up a second package of a powdered drink to get enough flavor in there. I'd only wind up using half of the second package and the rest of it would go to waste. MiO makes it easier to adjust for the size of your beverage container with no waste.<br /><br />Onto the flavor -- tea-flavored drinks can be VERY hit and miss but MiO's peach tea flavor is surprisingly pleasant. When you first mix it in, it fizzes for a moment. I have to admit I was pretty skeptical. But the flavor of this was far superior to any flavored teas that come in jars as well as any brand of single-serving powder packets that I've tried. Its flavor teeters somewhere between the powdered teas and the fresh-brewed/bottled teas. I would definitely buy this product and can't wait to try some of their other flavors!\n",

We were very pleased to find it here on Amazon (sold by Nutricity).  Not only did its mere presence make us happy, but the price per box was actually cheaper than any of the sporadic local sources we'd found.  Adding icing to the cake, there was free shipping on the case, so we snapped one up.  An Excellent (5 stars out of 5) Dutch Process cocoa.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />BTW:  at the time of writing, there was no picture of the product on the product page, so I uploaded one of the box front and one of the nutritional information (showing that it IS Dutch Process even though nothing on the product page says so).\n",

They want to offer you a great cup of coffee, that's environmentally friendly, and they want to help kids at the same time. You've won my heart. However, they had all the information you need to know about the company, its ideology, causes they support, and even where the coffee comes from and how the coffee is produced.<br /><br />Like I said, there were no brewing recommendations/directions on the package or in the box.

Like the other reviewers said, the Cinnamon Bun flavor pretty much tastes like a real cinnamon bun (haven't tried the other flavors yet). I say \"pretty much\" because it still has a very slight gritty texture that's characteristic of a lot of protein bars (though it's possible it was made this way to emulate cookie dough). It's also pretty dense (i.e.; hard), but so is the Big 100 Crispy Apple Pie bar.<br /><br />Anyway, the first time I tried it (straight out of the package, non-microwaved), truth be told I wasn't completely blown away as I was with my other favorites, but it was still a welcome change of flavor. When heated up though, the taste ramps up several notches. This bar really is FAAAAAAR better when warm, and now I can't get enough of it. haha.\n",

It's kind of an science kit that lets you create incredibly creative food for artistic presentation. Very cool.<br /><br />Each agent comes in a nice 50 gram size so you have plenty of opportunity to try different techniques before deciding which agents you want to buy in larger sizes. The agents allow you to experiment with transformation (transforming high-fat liquids into powders), spherification (such as making fruit caviar), thickening, emulsification (dispursing liquids into fats, mostly) and gelification (creation of both soft and hard gels). It also comes with a small kit for storing the samples.<br /><br />I am impressed with the quality of the agents in this kit as well as quantity provided for experimenting. I'm even more impressed with the incredibly quick shipping by Artistre. I'm looking forward to further experimentation with the included agents, as well as trying a few items not in the kit - like the carbonating and foaming/aerating agents.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this kit for anyone looking to try the art of molecular gastronomy.

      "<span class=\"tiny\"> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>(* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Amazon)<br /><br />I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A\">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0\">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act \"stoned\" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As as far which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for \"marinating\" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a \"harmless, euphoric state\" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten.\n",

The two adult babies (6lbs and 17lbs) would eat 4-5 cans a day with dry also available.  The poo was horrible smelling.<br /><br />Wally world was clearing this out one day so I bought a couple cans.  OMG they both scarfed it down.  I went back to get the rest but it was gone.  No longer were my babies interested in the bad food.  This is shocking since I had tried everything after the pet food debacle a few years ago (even tried the frozen meat) and they wouldn't eat anything else.  I only use one of the larger cans a day and their poo smell has drastically lessened.<br /><br />I cant get this local so am thrilled to find it here with free shipping.  I LOVE Amazon, anything I need I come here first and what is better than having your purchases delivered to your door???<br /><br />I cant say your cats will eat this but if they are not hyper picky they should.

There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption.  Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.  Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers.\n",

The first time we gave him one was to keep him occupied while we were out having dinner, but to my horror, the mess he made while it dissolved in his hands and mouth didnt help us enjoy a meal. The table cloth, high chair and his clothes were all smeared with mush within a few short minutes. I had to take it away from him. The second time was at home (where I could bear the mess alittle more) I gave him a piece to entertain himself while I prepared dinner. He was entertained with it in his highchair for awhile - just enough time for me to wash the rice twice before putting them in the rice cooker, then I heard him coughing and gagging. Thankfully, he was only an arm reach away from me. When I stuck my finger into his mouth, I found the cause to be the 1/3 of the biscuit broken in there!

      "The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.<br />We get more on our hands then our Golden gets in his mouth.<br />When we try to turn the ball for our dog, even we find it difficult.<br /><br />The roller BALL is a concern, we don't consider it 'pet safe'.<br />If our Golden Retriver got this bottle,<br />he could easily bite this roller ball out and would try to eat it.<br /><br />The ball requires a strong tounge to move it, even at that it gets stuck.<br />We can't imagine this stik being at all compatible with small dogs.<br />If you squeeze the bottle to force the liquid out around the ball<br />most of that drops to the ground between licks.<br /><br />This would be a great idea if it worked, and was truely 'pet safe'.\n",

      "My boys used to love this Strawberry Yogurt Burst in 2011, but lost interest for a while. Now the 6 year old wanted bad, saying \"I want Bursty!\" but its no where found in grocery stores. It's understandable that different flavors keep coming out and if a supermarket is to carry every flavor of Cheerios it would have to dedicate entire isle for all varieties of the brand!<br /><br />Luckily Amazon carries it and price is reasonable. 5 stars for both the cereal itself for the Yogurt Burst lovers and Amazon.\n",

      "Wonderful Coffee - absolutely delicious - love the frothy flavor\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "Senseo Dark Roast is a wonderfully flavored coffee designed for use in the Senseo machine - unfortunately this machine is almost never sold in brick and mortar stores anymore and Amazon is about the last place you can buy one.  In fact, we bought a backup when we realized this was occurring so we would always have access.  AND we THOUGHT surely Amazon would continue to at least sell the coffee since it's so difficult to find in local stores - but about two weeks ago Amazon's Subscribe and Save service notified us Dark Roast would no longer be available and recommended another brand of Dark Roast - which was awful.  Senseo Dark Roast coffee is incredible - best coffee we've ever drank and I'm 62 years old and have been drinking coffee for nearly 50 years - honestly, if I have to purchase it from European suppliers, I guess I will because there is no other real substitute for this wonderfully delicious coffee.  I've even written to Senseo on their web site and they don't respond - so something is happening here, not sure what.  But if you can find this Dark Roast, buy it - because you will not be disappointed.  It is THE best pod coffee out there.<br /><br />Why would Amazon stop selling this coffee? Dark Roast has a very loyal following and comments on every blog or review site are almost all favorable - PLEASE - BRING IT BACK!  If enough of us indicate an interest, perhaps Amazon will reconsider - after all, the continue to sell the other flavors (for now?) but not Dark Roast - which is hands down the best.<br /><br />UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2012:  Senseo Dark Roast is BACK! YEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  Finally, after I had to switch to alternative pods, Senseo finally got their act together and started production at their new facility - I don't know all the details, but basically they shut down their production of this particular line (perhaps others) and sold the product line to another retailer - so we had a down period of several months when it was all but impossible to find this product on line (and it will never, I'm told, be in the brick and mortars again) - WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!  This is THE best coffee out there, bar none.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, while we were anxiously waiting for our first shipment of Senseo Dark Roast in months our Senseo Supreme coffee maker broke down (probably due to using alternative pods that don't fit!)  So our shipment arrived and no coffee maker (we love the froth on top, so their new machine by Hamilton Beach I think it is, does not produce \"froth\" so not a viable option) - anyway, we reached out to Senseo Customer Service - we are many years out of warranty and Philips no longer makes the Senseo Supreme machine - OH NO!  Now what.  CS rep says there is nothing they can do to help.  So I clicked on the Corporate Relations link on their site and shot off an email to the big cheese.  GUESS WHAT?  A nice lady (Dolores) wrote me back and said she would get me a refurbished machine, no problem.  We thought great - and waited, and waited - and waited - almost a month and no machine came - so I wrote her back and ask for tracking - she checked and the order was still in the system; seems she forgot to click the submit button to the fulfillment center so it was just sitting there in limbo.  She corrected this and apologized, machine came a few days later.  Just like a new machine, could not tell that it was in any way refurbished - even included a bag of dark roast!! (stale, out of date by 9 months, but was still drinkable, just a little more bold than normal.)<br /><br />Senseo came through for us - they know they have very loyal customers and appreciate them - and while the disruption in supply was annoying, we are just thankful we can still buy this product on Amazon - although the price did go up by $13 a case (or $2 a bag) and there is no more Subscribe and Save capability (please Amazon, restore this savings and if possible, please lower the price back to a more competitive level with other pods - under or about $4/bag!?!?)\n",

      "Very Bergamot-y Tea!\n",
      "------------------\n",
      "****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me; still it was different and enjoyable to try. The bergamot flavor is strong, not subtle, and a bit overwhelming---it's all you can taste.<br /><br />The ingredients of this tea are premium black teas with pure oil of bergamot---that's all.<br /><br />The manufacturer writes: \"Oil of bergamot comes from the rind of a citrus fruit which grows very well in the Calabria region of Italy. Pure top quality oil of bergamot is expensive but no blend or man-made flavoring can match the ethereal aroma and finely nuanced flavor of the real thing.<br />Certain Earl Grey fanatics have grown especially fond of the top grade Calabrian oil of bergamot that we use and have asked for more, ..More,... MORE! Thus was born Stash Double Bergamot Earl Grey. In our Double Bergamot Earl Grey tea, the black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the oil of bergamot takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it.\"<br /><br />I must not be adventurous enough. I do agree with the manufacturer, though, and it might be the tea for you if you're a huge fan of bergamot and want a lot of it, and I also agree that it tastes pure, not soapy or bitter at all.<br />****\n",

      "The flavor of the chai seems a bit weak to me. Even the smell right out of the foil wrapper was mild. I expected a much stronger spice note. I could smell the cloves, but the cinnamon caught my attention first. I brewed up a cup and added a small amount of half-and-half and a teensy bit of sugar. The result was a mild, smooth tea with topnotes of spice, but not much spice flavor.<br /><br />I tried Higgins & Burke Earl Grey and enjoyed it, but this chai is a disappointment for me. I had expected something much stronger. I would categorize it as a scented tea because there wasn't much flavor, only some fragrance. Still, it is a nice tea -- it's not objectionably strong or bitter, and that's fine. It's just doesn't have the gusto I was expecting.\n",
